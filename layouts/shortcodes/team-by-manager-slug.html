{{- /* team-by-manager-slug is a handy little shortcode
  that allows you to display a filtered list of all the team members fetched from
  the `www-gitlab-com` repository -
  https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/tree/master/data/team_members/person

  This information is fetched and concatenated into `data/public/team.yml` which
  this shortcode then filters.

  Usage:
  {{ team-by-member-slug manager="managerslug" team="teamregex" }}

  - `managerslug` must match the respective `reports_to` value
  - `teamregex` will filter based on the `role` value

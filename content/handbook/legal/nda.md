- **Only team members with signature authority can execute agreements on behalf of GitLab, including Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs).**
  - See the [Signatory Matrix](https://internal.gitlab.com/handbook/company/authorization-matrix/expenses-and-signatures/#signature-authority---sales-and-vendor-contracts) to identify individuals that may sign. If you have any questions, contact [#legal](https://gitlab.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C78E74A6L) in Slack.

## Customer NDAs

Team members with DocuSign access can use this process to send the standard pre-signed GitLab NDA for signature (all Sales team members have DocuSign access).

1. Log into DocuSign and select `Use a Template` from the dropdown menu under `Start`.
1. On the left, select `Shared with Me` and locate the `Non-Disclosure Agreement Pre-Signed Template`.
1. Click the template and `Add Selected`.
1. Under `Recipient`, enter the signer's name and email address.
1. Under `GitLab Team Member`, add anyone else who needs to be cc'd on the signed copy, or click the trash icon to delete this row if not needed.
1. Do **not** delete or make any changes to the `GitLab NDA Tracker` fields (this is for the LACA team to track copies of NDAs).
1. Click Send.
1. Upload the fully executed NDA to the customer account in Salesforce.

### Non-Standard Requests

For a non-standard NDA, open a [Legal Request](/handbook/legal/customer-negotiations/#how-to-reach-the-legal-commercial-team) in Salesforce.

## Vendors or Other Third-Party NDAs

The process above is only related to NDAs with customers. If a team member is engaging a new vendor or third party, GitLab's mNDA **must** be executed with them first before sharing any type of confidential information.

To initiate an NDA request with a vendor or third-party:

1. Log into Zip via Okta.
2. Select the **Request a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)** request type from the [+New Request](https://gitlab.ziphq.com/create-workflow-request) options list and complete the intake form.
3. A Vendor Form will automatically be sent through Zip to the vendor contact you enter and provide them a copy of GitLab's [mutual NDA](/handbook/finance/procurement/vendor-guidelines/mutual-non-disclosure-agreement/) via a click-through process.
4. If a vendor has questions about the NDA, they can submit them through the Zip Vendor Form for your review. Zip will guide you through the process for review and escalation to the Procurement and Legal teams as needed.

**Please note that a vendor's request to negotiate NDA terms may delay or impact the opportunity and its intended time frame.** It is recommended that team members encourage the vendor in initial discussions to accept GitLab's standard mNDA when received to not impact the timing or opportunity to do business with us.

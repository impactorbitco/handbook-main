## Our Mission

The Public Policy function enables GitLab to compete and innovate as freely as possible while advocating for sound governance that benefits our customers and the broader technology community. We do so by:

- **Anticipating & Analyzing**: Providing advance notice and analysis of relevant global policy developments and collaborating cross-functionally to guide necessary internal preparations or responses.
- **Advocating & Shaping**: Proactively engaging with industry peers and policymakers to inform policy development in ways that support innovation, enhance security, and benefit our customers.
- **Building Trust & Credibility**: Establishing GitLab as a trusted partner to policymakers by leveraging our unique perspective as the most comprehensive, intelligent DevSecOps platform for software innovation and our experience as a global, all-remote organization that serves diverse markets and communities.

## Our Approach

Situated within GitLab's Legal and Corporate Affairs Team (LACA), GitLab's Public Policy team serves as GitLab's primary interface with policymakers, and advocates for policies that enable innovation while addressing governments' legitimate security, privacy, and governance objectives. While we collaborate with GitLab's Public Sector team on shared objectives, our focus is on policy advocacy rather than government sales.

The Public Policy team supports practical government policies that recognize the unique value of open source development and the critical role of intelligent DevSecOps platforms in modern digital infrastructure.

We focus on public policy areas including artificial intelligence governance; customer choice and public sector modernization; privacy, cybersecurity, and data governance; open source software policy; and sustainability. Our advocacy emphasizes that effective policy should:

- Support competitive markets that drive innovation and customer value
- Recognize the security benefits of transparency and community review inherent in open source approaches
- Promote transparent and ethical approaches to the development and deployment of AI models and systems
- Enable organizations to maintain control over their technology choices and implementation
- Foster international cooperation and interoperability in digital governance

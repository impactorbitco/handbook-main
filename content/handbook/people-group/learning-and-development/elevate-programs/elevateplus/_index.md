Workshop Detail:

Communicating the Vision: A compelling vision means nothing if it isn’t clearly communicated. This executive-level discussion empowers senior leaders to translate bold ideas into actionable direction by effectively communicating a strategic vision. Participants will explore the VISION Cascade, a structured approach to articulating impact, aligning stakeholders, and inspiring commitment across the organization.

Inclusive Leadership in Action: The most effective leaders don’t just talk about inclusion—they model it daily. This executive-level discussion challenges senior leaders to examine how their everyday behaviors shape inclusion, trust, and collaboration across teams. Through guided reflection and a leadership self-audit, participants will identify patterns that either reinforce or hinder inclusive practices at the individual, interpersonal, and systemic levels.

Managing Up to the C-Suite: This executive-level discussion focuses on the critical leadership competency of managing up; an essential driver of organizational influence and strategic alignment. Effective upward communication and collaboration are vital for accelerating initiatives, shaping company direction, and fostering stronger executive partnerships.

Crafting Successful Strategies: This executive-level discussion explores effective strategy development, focusing on strategic clarity, assumption testing, and risk mitigation. Through discussions, case studies, and hands-on exercises, participants will learn to define strategy, conduct TOWS analysis, and pressure-test assumptions to ensure success.

Mobilizing Teams around Strategies: This executive-level session empowers senior leaders to close the gap between strategy and execution by effectively mobilizing their teams. Participants will explore what true mobilization looks like—and why it’s essential for driving business results, boosting engagement, and sustaining momentum. Using a guided self-audit, leaders will assess their current practices across four key pillars: gaining buy-in, securing commitment, managing resources, and driving aligned execution.

## LevelUp

We're currently rolling out a new platform for LevelUp to better support the pace, demand, complexity, and culture of GitLab. This overhaul will allow team members to engage around learning in a completely different way, that links in with Talent, career pathing, project opportunities, and more.

Learning today goes way beyond self-paced content, far passed webinars, leaps above documents; learning is much much more. And GitLab's new "**LevelUp**" (integrated talent EXPERIENCE platform) will show you just how dynamic learning, growth, skills development, and performance can go.

Consider this page your LevelUp information highway. Over the coming weeks, you'll see updates, announcements, and rollout plans here.

## What's the difference between LevelUp and GitLab University?

With the launch of this new technology solution, it's important to note that LevelUp and GitLab University our now **two completely separate platforms**, each with a different purpose and audience. GitLab University is used for customer education, whereas LevelUp is designed to support team member learning and professional development.

| | GitLab University | LevelUp |
|---|---|---|
| **Target Audience** | Designed for educating customers and community members | Designed for educating internal team members |
| **Platform** | Runs on ThoughtIndustries Learning System | Runs on Cornerstone Talent Experience Platform |
| **Training Type** | Delivers external-facing product training | Delivers internal training for team members - including product, professional development, and compliance training |

## Benefits and Features

The new Cornerstone Talent Experience Platform (TXP) offers significant improvements over our current learning management system, and is specifically designed to support internal employee development and career growth at GitLab. Key features include:

- Internal gigs and side projects to provide hands-on learning opportunities
- Enhanced management tools for training assignment and recommendations
- Advanced user-generated content capabilities
- Seamless integration with our talent management infrastructure, ensuring skills development is reflected in performance data
- Skills library linked to GitLab job architecture

## Platform Guide

### Content Creation in LevelUp

There are a number of different ways content can be shared in LevelUp:

- **Bringing in content from third parties via direct integration** - e.g. Masterclass, Hone, etc.
- **Creating content natively in LevelUp** - Best for simple, quick courses without much need for interactivity, or auditing of completion etc.
- **Creating content in third party tools and uploading it into LevelUp** - Best for longer form content - built in collaboration with Talent Development team

Here I will break down each of these in more detail.

### Bringing in third party content integrations 

LevelUp runs on the Cornerstone Learning Management System. Cornerstone is one of the largest LMS platforms in the world, and as such, has partnerships with a number of content partners that can be set up to integrate directly into our learning catalogue. For example - O'Reilly, BizLibrary, CyberU, MadeCraft.

These partnerships are generally set up via the Talent Development team. If you or your team are working with a content partner or vendor that could integrate with Cornerstone, please get in touch in the **#learninganddevelopment** Slack channel and we can explore the opportunity.

### Creating content natively in LevelUp

LevelUp allows you to create content directly within the platform using three main content types: **SmartCards**, **Pathways**, and **Journeys**.

### SmartCards

SmartCards are individual pieces of content that form the foundation of learning in LevelUp. You can create various types of SmartCards:

- **Web URL** - Link to external web content
- **Uploaded Content** - Share documents, videos, or other files
- **Text Card** - Write articles or text-based content directly in the platform
- **Poll** - Gather feedback or opinions from learners
- **Quiz** - Test knowledge with multiple choice questions
- **Live Event** - Schedule and manage virtual training sessions
- **Project** - Assign work that requires submission and grading
- **SCORM File** - Upload industry-standard e-learning packages

#### How to create a SmartCard

1. Click **More > Tools > Manage content**
2. Select **SmartCard**
3. Choose the type of SmartCard you want to create
4. Fill in the required information:
   - **Title** - Give your content a clear, descriptive name
   - **Description** - Explain what learners will gain from this content
   - **Upload/Link** - Depending on your SmartCard type, upload a file or paste a URL
   - **Skills** (optional) - Tag up to 3 skills that this content develops
   - **Tags** (optional) - Add keywords to help others find your content
   - **Level** - Select Beginner, Foundation, or Advanced
   - **Duration** - Estimate how long it will take to complete
   - **Content Type** - Categorize your content (e.g., Article, Video, Course)
5. Set your **Privacy Settings** - Choose whether the content is Public or Private
6. Click **Create Card** to publish, or **Save as Draft** to finish later

**Tip:** The platform has AI-powered features that can help rewrite your titles and descriptions to make them more engaging. Look for the "Rewrite it for me" option when hovering over these fields.

### Pathways

A Pathway is a curated collection of SmartCards organized around a specific topic or learning goal. Think of it as a structured learning journey - for example, an onboarding program for new employees or a certification course.

Pathways allow you to:

- Combine multiple SmartCards in a logical sequence
- Mix different content types (videos, articles, quizzes, etc.)
- Set prerequisites and mark certain cards as optional
- Award badges upon completion

#### How to create a Pathway

1. Click **More > Tools > Manage content > Pathway**
2. Enter your Pathway details:
   - **Pathway Title** - Name your learning path
   - **Description** - Explain the learning objectives and what learners will achieve
   - **Upload Thumbnail** (optional) - Add an image to make your Pathway visually appealing
   - **Skills** (optional) - Associate up to 3 skills with this Pathway
   - **Tags** (optional) - Add searchable keywords
   - **Level** - Choose the difficulty level
   - **Provider Name** - Identify who created this content
   - **Badge** (optional) - Set up a badge that learners earn upon completion
3. Click **Continue**
4. In the **Add SmartCards** section:
   - Search for existing SmartCards to add to your Pathway
   - Click **Create New SmartCard** to build content directly within the Pathway
   - Use **Dynamic Pathway** to automatically generate up to 10 relevant SmartCards based on a topic
   - Drag and drop SmartCards to reorder them
   - Mark SmartCards as optional using the checkbox (at least one card must remain required)
5. Click **Save as Draft** to continue editing later, or **Publish** to make it available to learners

**Important note:** SmartCards created directly within a Pathway cannot be used independently or in other Pathways/Journeys - they're tied to that specific Pathway.

---

### Journeys

Journeys take learning to the next level by combining multiple Pathways into a comprehensive learning experience. They're organized into sections, where each section can contain multiple SmartCards or even entire Pathways.

There are three types of Journeys:

- **Self-Paced** - Learners can access all sections immediately in any order
- **Progressive Unlocking** - Learners must complete one section before the next unlocks
- **Time-Based** - Content is released on a schedule over 1-12 weeks with a specific start date

Journeys are ideal for complex skill development programs or long-term learning initiatives like leadership development tracks or certification programs.

#### How to create a Journey

1. Click **More > Tools > Manage content > Journey**
2. Fill in the Journey details:
   - **Journey Title** - Name your learning journey
   - **Description** - Outline what learners will accomplish through this Journey
   - **Upload Thumbnail** (optional) - Add a visual element
   - **Skills** (optional) - Associate up to 3 skills
   - **Tags** (optional) - Add searchable keywords
   - **Level** - Select the proficiency level
   - **Journey Type** - Choose Self-Paced, Progressive Unlocking, or Time-Based
   - **Badge** (optional) - Reward learners with a badge upon completion
3. Click **Continue**
4. Organize your content into sections:
   - Click to enter a **Section Title** for each grouping of content
   - Within each section, search for existing SmartCards or create new ones
   - Add existing Pathways as complete sections (you can also add a Pathway after saving the Journey by using the Context Menu on the Pathway)
   - Use **Dynamic Pathway** to auto-generate relevant content
   - Choose how the section displays: **Tile View** or **List View**
   - Click **+ Create New Section** to add more sections
   - Mark SmartCards as optional (at least one must remain required per section)
5. Click **Save as Draft** or **Publish**

**Best practice:** Design each section to build upon the previous one, creating a sense of progression. Try to keep similar content types together within sections for better learner engagement.

## Creating content in third party tools and uploading it into LevelUp

If you're putting together a course that has requirements around completion tracking, or you'll be assigning it to a large group of users, it might be better to build it in collaboration with the Talent Development team using the **Articulate Rise** authoring tool. 

The team has a number of licenses available for Rise that they use for authoring e-learning content. Depending on availability, demand, and the nature of your request, you may be granted a license yourself to create the content, or a Talent Development team member may collaborate with you to build the content themselves and go through stages of iteration and feedback to get your course to a completed state.

Once completed, courses built in Articulate Rise are exported as SCORM files and uploaded to LevelUp as SCORM SmartCards, ensuring proper completion tracking and reporting.

**Interested in building a course with Articulate Rise?** Get in touch in **#learninganddevelopment** and a team member will connect with you to:

- Learn more about the nature of your request
- Demo the Rise authoring tool
- Understand your full requirements

## FAQs

- **I completed a number of learning courses in the Legacy platform, what will happen to my learning data?**
- Your learning history may not be migrated when you first login to the new LevelUp system, but all team members' learning data is preserved, and will be migrated as the system over the next weeks and months, team members don't need to take any action.
- You do not need to retake any courses you've already completed.

- **I've noticed somethiing in the new system that isn't working properly, or would like to give feedback on a platform feature, who should I tell?**
- Please share any feedback in the [LevelUp feedback issue here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/learning-development/general/-/issues/830).

- **When will I lose access to the legacy system?**
- The legacy Level Up system uses the same vendor (ThoughtIndustries), as GitLab University, which serves our partnes and customers with GitLab product training and education content. Therefore the system won't be going away, but we will likely sunset it for team members at some point. We'll announce more when a full timeline is planned, but access won't be restricted, and it is expected to be after Q2.
- For a transition period, you'll still have access to both systems.

- **Will all content be migrated to the new system?**
- We are conducting a full content audit from the legacy system, and all relevant content will be migrated to the new LevelUp. If you notice something missing that should be added, please let us know in the [LevelUp feedback issue here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/learning-development/general/-/issues/830), or the #learninganddevelopment slack channel.

- **How do I login to the new system?**
- Access will be granted via Okta - search the LevelUp Okta tile.

- **I have a question about how something works in LevelUp, who should I ask?**
- Please let us know in the [LevelUp feedback issue here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/learning-development/general/-/issues/830).

- **I have started a course, but my progress bar shows 0% completion. Is my progress lost?**
- Some courses only report completion, not the ongoing progress. The LevelUp progress bar will reflect it once you finish the course.

- **I received a notification about compliance training, how can I check what courses I've completed in LevelUp??**
- The best place to check is your [learning transcript](https://levelup.csod.com/DeepLink/ProcessRedirect.aspx?module=transcript), which can be accessed from the top navigation bar in the system by choosing More > System Transcript.

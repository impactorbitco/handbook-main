### Work With Us

## Available Learning and Development Support

The Learning and Development team is available to support GitLab teams in the following capacities. Requests will be evaluated as they come in based on team's capacity for support, business impact, correlation to company OKRs, and number of impacted users.

| Support Model | When to use this process |
| ----- | ----- |
| Creating a new learning pathway | Create a new learning pathway or course for any audience |
| Uploading to company learning platform | Add new or existing learning content to the LXP |
| Integrating external content to learning platform | Add off-the-shelf learning from another provider |
| Requesting content review | L&D review of your learning content for handbook first, adult learning theory, and bias for async alignment |
| Requesting new content creation | You'd like the L&D team to **create** or **host** learning content for your team |

We review and classify requests based on the scalability and possible organizational impact. Learning solutions that can be applied and used company-wide take priority. Our process includes:

- Evaluate the strategic impact of the learning session
- Determine the level of work associated with the learning requirement
- Assess the impacted audience groups of the session
- Identify measures of success
- Assess dates of delivery with the course schedule and forecast a future date

We're formalizing a more structured process to engage with the team going forward, but for now please get started by opening an issue the [lxp-contributions project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/learning-development/lxp-contributions) and tagging a member of the L&D team to review. If you have any questions, you can always reach out to us in Slack via `#learninganddevelopment`.

## How we work

### GitLab Product Training

For in depth GitLab product training, check out the [Get Started with GitLab](https://university.gitlab.com/pages/getting-started) resources on GitLab University, and take a look at the various certifications available, which are freely accessibly for GitLab Team Members. The Talent Development team do not create learning content for product training. If you have any queries or requests for product training, please get in touch with the digital success team in the #digital-success Slack channel

### Tools

The L&D team frequently uses the following tools for creating and communicating learning opportunities at GitLab.

| Tool | Purpose |
| ----- | -------- |
| [Powtoon](https://www.powtoon.com/) | Video Creation |
| [LucidChart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/) | Interactive Diagrams |
| [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) | Image and infographic creation |
| [Articulate/Rise 360](https://www.articulate.com/) | Course Authoring |
| [Genial.ly](https://app.genial.ly/dashboard) | Create Interactive Images |

#### Rise 360

Rise 360 is an excellent tool for creating engaging, interactive elearning content that integrates seamlessly with our new LevelUp learning system. While LevelUp offers many great features, its interactive content authoring options can be somewhat limited, making Rise 360 a valuable complement for developing more dynamic and visually appealing courses. We maintain a small number of Rise 360 licenses that can be easily redistributed to team members based on project needs. If you're interested in creating a Rise course and would like access to our licenses, please reach out in #learninganddevelopment where our team can support your course development needs and help you get started.RetryClaude can make mistakes. Please double-check responses.

## Developing Learning Content

If you're looking to develop your own e-learning content, there are a number of things to think about in order to maximize it's effectiveness.

### Learning Content Accessibility Guidelines

In July 2024, GitLab published the first iteration of our [Learning Content Accessibility Guidelines](/handbook/legal/ethics-compliance-program/learning-content-accessibility-guidelines/).

We ask that team members who create both internal and external learning content:

- Familiarize themselves with these guidelines
- Apply these guidelines when creating learning content for internal and external use, when applicable
- Revisit existing learning content you have created, to consider whether any updates are appropriate

### Training Content Development Principles

1. **Know Your Audience** - Analyze and assess the course audience. Ensure that all audience needs are accounted for at every level in the organization you are delivering the training too.
1. **Define Learning Objectives** - Highlight the learner outcome. Consider developing two to three broad overall statements of what the audience will achieve.
1. **Break Down Complex Information** - Consider breaking down complex information into easy to digest visuals or text. Reference the handbook but do not be afraid to create a visual representation or use storytelling for the audience.
1. **Engage the Learner** - Adults learn through practice and involvement. Consider using tools to engage learners in a virtual setting like [Mentimeter](https://www.mentimeter.com/) or [Kahoot](https://kahoot.com/) to stimulate interactivity.
1. **Implement Blended Learning Course Content** - Give the learners pre-course work to read and review before the learning session. Use off-the-shelf resources and ensure the content is applicable to what will be covered in the session. Follow up to gauge how they've applied what they've learned on the job through surveys and questionnaires.

### Application of Adult Learning Theory

Adults learn differently in the workplace than in traditional learning environments or how they learned growing up. If you are developing training, consider applying principles related to Adult Learning Theories, those include:

1. **Transformative learning:** Learning should change the individual through transformative learning approaches. Start with learning experiences that appeal to your specific audience, and then move to activities that challenge assumptions and points of view.
1. **Self-directed learning:** Emphasize informal learning experiences. Infuse applications of pre-reads and post-course follow up. Have the participants bring up examples of self-directed learning that they have taken that is related to the training course.
1. **Experiential learning:** Adults learn through experiences and by doing. When designing a learning experience, apply activities to stimulate learning by doing through role-playing, simulations, virtual labs, case studies, etc.
1. **Andragogy:** Design learning experiences with the assumption that your participants will come to the table with their own set of life experiences and motivations. Adults tend to direct their own learning, learn better by doing, and want to quickly apply their learning to concrete situations.

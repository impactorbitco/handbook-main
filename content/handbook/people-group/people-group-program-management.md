## Overview

Program Managers in the People Group drive alignment, measurement, and execution of our most impactful business objectives and deliverables. They keep our division organized, on track and connected through effective project management while maintaining agility and cross-functional collaboration.

## Key Competencies

Regardless of the team, our Program Management key competencies are consistent to ensure the function at its core remains aligned. While the job families remain the [SSOT](/teamops/shared-reality/#single-source-of-truth-ssot) for roles across GitLab, a few key competencies and behaviors to expect from all Program Managers within the People Group are:

| Key Competency | Behavior |
| ------ | ------ |
| Subject matter expertise | Guides programs within their functional area |
| Effective communication | Provide regular project status updates and project visibility to stakeholders |
| Growth mindset | Drive continuous improvement through retrospectives and optimization |
| Change management | Facilitate pivots and timeline adjustments effectively |
| Stakeholder management | Keep teams aligned and accountable for executing deliverables |
| Strategic planning | Ensures work aligns with the division's and organization's overall goals |

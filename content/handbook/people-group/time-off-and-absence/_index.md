### Understanding Time Away at GitLab

Use the **Time Away Philosophy** section below to understand GitLab's approach to time off, communication expectations, and how to track time away in Workday. The **Time-Off Types** and **Leave Types** pages include detailed information about how these can be used by GitLab team members.

### About Our Terminology

We use two terms to organize our policies, and we recognize that terminology varies globally.

1. **"Time off"** (also called annual leave, holiday, or vacation in some regions) refers to shorter absences like vacation days, sick days, and public holidays—the day-to-day time away that you plan or use as needed.
1. **"Leave"** (sometimes called extended leave or leave of absence) refers to longer, approved absences for specific life circumstances such as parental leave or medical leave—these typically require a separate request and approval process.

While the words we use may differ from region to region, the distinction is about duration and purpose: regular time away versus extended, circumstance-specific absences. Both policies are designed to support your wellbeing and work-life balance.

## Flexible Paid Time Off (PTO)

*This page focuses specifically on GitLab's Flexible PTO policy and is written with a focus on using PTO to fulfill personal obligations, rest or recharge, enjoy a vacation, or spend time with family and friends. You can learn more about GitLab's overall Philosophy to Time Away from Work [here](/handbook/people-group/time-off-and-absence/time-away-philosophy/) and find more detailed policies on all [Time Off types](/handbook/people-group/time-off-and-absence/time-off-types/) and [Leave types](/handbook/people-group/time-off-and-absence/leave-types/) in their respective handbook sections.*

### Overview

GitLab offers a Flexible PTO policy that empowers team members to take the time they need while ensuring business continuity. This policy reflects our values of transparency, collaboration, and GitLab's overall [Philosophy to Time Away from Work](/handbook/people-group/time-off-and-absence/time-away-philosophy/#gitlabs-philosophy-to-time-away-from-work).

- Our Flexible PTO policy means that as long as you have coordinated with your manager about your planned time off and made a coverage plan, you are free to take PTO.
- GitLab does not set a specific limit on the amount of PTO a team member can take per year. However, for time off exceeding 25 consecutive calendar days (including weekends and holidays), special permission is required from your Manager, People Business Partner, and the Absence Management Team at leaves@gitlab.com.
- All team members are encouraged to take adequate time off to recharge.
- Team members are not allowed to substitute PTO for sick time. If taking time off for medical needs or sick time, whether physical or mental-health-related, please follow our [Sick Time Policy](/handbook/people-group/time-off-and-absence/time-off-types/#sick-time).
- We strongly recommend taking at least two consecutive weeks of time off and at minimum 25 days total throughout the year.

### PTO Protocols (Planning and Coordination)

- Discuss planned time off with your manager first and provide as much notice as possible, but at least twice as many days as your planned time off (e.g., 6 business days notice for 3 days off).
- Coordinate with your team and stakeholders, especially during popular holiday periods.
- Managers will evaluate PTO requests against team deliverables and business needs.
  - If a manager needs to request changes to your PTO plans, they will do so within 48 hours and specify which goal or result may be impacted.
  - If no compromise can be reached, escalate to your manager's manager.
- Some departments have specific windows when team presence is critical - check your department handbook page if applicable.

### How to Enter PTO in Workday

1. You can enter PTO directly into the Workday app, or through the Workday Slack integration.
2. Select the day(s) you want to take > Click “Time-Off” > Click “Paid Time Off” > Optional: add a comment > Click “Submit”

**Important**: All team members must log their time away in Workday. To read more about the Workday Module, please refer to: [Workday: Single Source of Truth for Absence](/handbook/people-group/time-off-and-absence/time-away-philosophy/#workday-single-source-of-truth-for-absence).

### How to Prepare for PTO

Please read the [Communicating (& Preparing for) Planned Time Away](/handbook/people-group/time-off-and-absence/time-away-philosophy/#communicating--preparing-for-planned-time-away) page. Managers may have additional action-items review/complete before going on PTO, please visit the [Manager Toolkit](https://theloop.gitlab.com/site/5ea8f77b-a0c3-4983-ba40-1463a96d8e21/page/772afb15-974d-4798-a383-fd7b49ca724d).

### Global Statutory Requirements

As a global company, GitLab is committed to complying with all statutory requirements in the countries where our team members reside. While our Flexible PTO policy often exceeds local requirements, specific entitlements and obligations vary by location. Please refer to your [location-specific policy](/handbook/total-rewards/benefits/general-and-entity-benefits/#entity-specific-benefits) for details about statutory minimums, accruals, and carryover rules that may apply to you. Ensuring compliance with these requirements is a shared responsibility between team members and GitLab.

## Public Holiday

### Overview

As a company that prides itself on a [family & friends](/handbook/values/#family-and-friends-first-work-second) first approach no one is expected to attend calls on days they are not working or out of the office for an official public holiday. We encourage all team members to take time off for public holidays. As a company that values [Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging](/handbook/values/#diversity-inclusion--belonging-competency), public holidays will **not** be pre-loaded to Workday, instead team members have the flexibility to elect different dates and celebrate what’s important to them, as long as they do not exceed the balance in Workday. This means **YOU CAN CHOOSE** the public holidays you want to take.

- All team members will see a public holiday accrual balance in Workday.
- The balance is country specific and was determined based on the local and/or contractual requirements.
- Balances are reviewed and updated if appropriate annually, based on benchmarked data for “National Holidays”.*
- The balance must be used within the calendar year, unused public holiday balances will **not** rollover to the following calendar year.

***Note*** *: Contractors of GitLab GSI (previously IT BV) are eligible for general benefits but not entity-specific benefits (including public holidays). However, GitLab has chosen to provide a standardized allocation of 12 public holidays as part of our commitment to supporting all team members. The 12-day allocation matches the weighted average of public holidays globally across countries where team members are employed by GitLab.

## Sick Time

*This policy outlines GitLab's approach to sick time for all team members. It is designed to complement, not replace, any statutory sick leave policies you may be eligible for in your country of residence. Team members are encouraged to familiarize themselves with their location’s statutory reporting requirements and entitlements in their respective [handbook sections](/handbook/total-rewards/benefits/general-and-entity-benefits/#entity-specific-benefits).*

### Overview

GitLab's sick time policy supports team members who need time away to recover from illness. This policy aligns with our CREDIT values.

- Sick time refers to time away needed to recover from short-term illness or for preventative care.
- This includes personal illness (such as COVID-19, cold/flu, menstrual pain, surgery).
- ***But what if I need to care for an ill family member?*** Please follow the [Caregiver Sick Time Policy](/handbook/people-group/time-off-and-absence/time-off-types/#caregiver-sick-time).
- Except where required by applicable local law, GitLab’s sick time does not get paid out in case of termination, nor does it reduce your final paycheck in case of a negative balance.

### Sick Time Eligibility and Coverage

- GitLab’s Sick Time policy is administered *concurrently* with any statutory sick leave for which you may be eligible.
- Each GitLab team member may use up to 25 paid sick days, available from their first day of work. Eligibility is calculated on a rolling 12-month period.
  - *What does a rolling 12-month period mean?* A rolling 12-month calendar refers to a period that always spans exactly 12 consecutive months, but continuously shifts forward as time passes, so the start and end dates move forward together while maintaining a constant 12-month window.

### Reporting Procedures

*Important: Statutory reporting requirements vary depending on the country/location you reside in and will always supersede the reporting requirements outlined below. Please be sure to familiarize yourself with the reporting requirements in your [location](/handbook/total-rewards/benefits/general-and-entity-benefits/#entity-specific-benefits).*

{{% details summary="For Sick Absences 1-5 Consecutive Days" %}}

### For Sick Absences 1-5 Consecutive Days

### For Sick Absences that Exceed 6+ Consecutive Days

Sick absences that are 6 days or longer are considered a **leave of absence**.

1. Notify the Absence Management Team by submitting a HelpLab ticket.

1. Enter the time away in Workday by selecting the label "Out Sick".
   - *Note*: the Absence Management team may need to edit your entries or replace the entry with a Leave Type on your behalf.

Please be aware that the exact documentation required may vary by location (i.e. medical certificate, doctor’s note, fit note, etc.). Please review your employment contract or your country’s Sick Time policy to determine what documentation may be needed.

### Pay While on Sick Leave of Absence

Eligible team members will receive 100% of their weekly wages for up to 25 working days through the GitLab Sick Time policy and any applicable statutory pay. If you live in a country or US state where a statutory benefit is available, you will be required to apply for statutory sick pay (if eligible), and GitLab will supplement your statutory sick pay to equal 100% of your weekly wages. You will not receive more than 100% of your wages. If your leave extends beyond 25 working days, it will be unpaid by GitLab (subject to local requirements).

***FAQ: I’m in a Sales role and receive commission. How is that impacted while on Sick Leave?***

- For information about attainment, quota, or commissions while on non-parental leave, [this policy](https://internal.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/sales-commission/#leave-of-absences) found in the internal handbook may help. If this doesn't answer your questions or you have specific questions about your scenario, please submit a HelpLab ticket to the sales commission team directly, as they administer the Sales Incentives policies that apply to commission eligible team members on a leave of absence.

### Communicating Illness-Related Leave

All illness or medical related information should be handled confidentially and sensitively, protecting our team members’ personal information with great care.

Should a team member have a medical concern, they will have the choice of how much information to share with their manager and People Business Partner. Many team members find it helpful to discuss their situation with their manager and PBP, as both can provide valuable support during the leave period and upon return, especially when additional accommodations may be needed. Team members should feel empowered to share what they're comfortable with, knowing that any medical information will be handled confidentially and professionally.

If a team member prefers to keep medical details private, the Absence Management Team will coordinate with the People Business Partner and Manager **on a need-to-know basis, providing only essential information related to leave dates.**

Regardless of how much information is shared, managers must never disclose any illness-related details to other team members to ensure we respect the privacy of the affected individual. The goal is to create a supportive environment where team members can focus on their health while feeling confident their privacy is protected.

## Caregiver Sick Time

*This policy outlines GitLab's approach to caregiver sick time for all team members who need time away to care for a sick family member.

### Overview

GitLab's caregiver sick time policy supports team members who need time away to care for ill family members. This policy aligns with our CREDIT values.

- Caregiver sick time refers to time away needed to care for an ill family member.
- Eligible family members include parent(s), child(ren), spouse, domestic partner, grandparent(s), grandchild(ren), or sibling(s).
- Except where required by applicable local law, caregiver sick time does not get paid out in case of termination, nor does it reduce your final paycheck in case of a negative balance.

### Caregiver Sick Time Eligibility and Coverage

- GitLab's Caregiver Sick Time policy is administered *concurrently* with any statutory family care leave for which you may be eligible.
  - If you live in a country or state where a statutory benefit is available, you will be required to apply for statutory leave pay (if eligible), and GitLab will supplement your pay to equal 100% of your weekly wages. You will not receive more than 100% of your wages with statutory leave and Caregiver Leave combined.
- Each GitLab team member may use up to 25 paid caregiver sick days, available from their first day of work. Eligibility is calculated on a rolling 12-month period.
  - *What does a rolling 12-month period mean?* A rolling 12-month calendar refers to a period that always spans exactly 12 consecutive months, but continuously shifts forward as time passes, so the start and end dates move forward together while maintaining a constant 12-month window.

## Bereavement

*This policy outlines GitLab's approach to bereavement leave. In locations where statutory laws mandate specific bereavement leave provisions, those legal requirements will supersede this policy.*

### Overview

At GitLab, we understand that losing a loved one is one of life's most challenging experiences. This policy establishes guidelines for bereavement leave while maintaining our commitment to flexibility and support for team members during difficult times.

Bereavement leave at GitLab falls under our Flexible PTO framework, allowing team members to take the time they need when faced with a loss. This benefit is available to all team members on their first day of work.

{{% details summary="Key Principles" %}}

- **Flexible Duration**: There is no set limit on bereavement days. We recognize that grief is unique to each person and situation. You can take bereavement continuously or intermittently.
- **Inclusive Approach**: We don't restrict or tier leave based on relationship to the deceased. This includes loss of pregnancy (birthing and non-birthing parents), family members, friends, colleagues, and pets.
- **Manager Coordination**: As with all time off at GitLab, team members should coordinate with their manager about their needs and coverage plans.
- **Confidentiality**: Details shared about a loss will be treated with strict confidentiality and respect.

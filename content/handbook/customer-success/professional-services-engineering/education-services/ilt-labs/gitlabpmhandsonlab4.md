> Estimated time to complete: 45 minutes

## Objectives

A merge request is a proposal to incorporate changes from a source branch to a target branch. Merge requests help you manage the changes that are applied to your code. In this lab, you will learn how to set up and manage merge request approval rules in your projects. You can learn more about merge requests in the [documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/).

Approval rules define how many approvals a merge request must receive before it can be merged, and which users should do the approving. They can be used in conjunction with Code owners to ensure that changes are reviewed both by the group maintaining the feature, and any groups responsible for specific areas of oversight. See the [documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/approvals/rules.html) to learn more.

## Task A. Set merge request approval rules

1. Navigate to your **Family Budget Calculator** project inside the **Software > Core** subgroup.

1. In the left pane, click **Settings > Merge Requests**.

1. Scroll down to the **Merge request approvals** section and click **Add approval rule**.

1. In the **Rule name** field, enter `Infra team`.

1. In the **Groups** field, select your **Infrastructure** group. You may need to use the 'All groups' option and search for your top-level group.

    > To help reduce the search results, try searching for `/awesome/infrastructure`, or `yourgroupname/awesome/infrastructure`.

1. Click **Save changes**.

1. Back in the **Merge request approvals** section of the **Merge Requests** page, click **Add approval rule** to create a second project-level rule.

1. In the **Rule name** field, enter `Security operations`.

1. In the **Groups** field, select your **Security** group. You may need to use the 'all groups' option and search for your top-level group.

1. Click **Save changes**.

1. Back in the **Merge request approvals** section of the **Merge Requests** page, under **Approval Settings**, check the box next to **Prevent editing approval rules in merge requests.**

1. In the same section, ensure that **Prevent approval by the creator** is *unchecked*. This is necessary so we can approve our own merge requests in the training environment.

1. Click **Save changes**.

## Task B. Create a merge request

1. In your **Family Budget Calculator** project, click **Issues** in the left pane.

1. Click into your **Third-party financial services integration** issue.

1. Click on the **Create merge request** button at the bottom of the description of the issue.

1. In the **Branch name** field, change the text to read `update-db-docs-perf-tools`.

1. Ensure that the **Source (branch or tag)** is set to `main`.

1. Click **Create merge request**.

1. Type `Draft: Add performance tools to Family Budget Calculator documentation` in the **Title** field.

    > Putting **'Draft:'** at the beginning of your merge request means that the merge request will not occur until it has been marked as ready. This is used to note that a merge request is not ready to be merged yet, and to prevent accidental merges. Note that the **Mark as draft** checkbox below the title will also check automatically when **'Draft:'** is added to the title.

1. Remove `Closes #<issue-number>` from the **Description** field. We want to keep the original issue open for additional work.

    > If a merge request has `Closes #<issue-number>` in their description, the issue will be closed when the merge request is merged.

1. Verify that you are assigned to the merge request by checking the Assignees section. Also note any labels inherited from the issue, and any approval rules inherited from project settings.

1. Click the **Create Merge Request** button.

1. From the merge request details page, select **Code > Open in Web IDE** to edit files on the **update-db-docs-perf-tools** branch.

    > The Web IDE is an advanced editor with built-in ability to commit to your repository branches. You can use the Web IDE to make changes to multiple files directly from the GitLab UI. See the [documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/web_ide/) to learn more.

1. Click **README.md** from the left file pane.

1. Paste the following into **README.md**, beginning on line 3.

    ```markdown
    ## Performance tools
    The Family Budget Calculator currently uses HAProxy for load balancing.
    We are researching and testing additional tools to improve performance.
    ```

1. Click **Source Control** in the left pane (the third button from the top).

1. In the **Commit message** field, enter `Update docs with performance tools`

1. Ensure that the message "**Commit and push to update-db-docs-perf-tools branch**" is written in the red 'commit' box underneath your commit message.

1. Click **Commit and push to update-db-docs-perf-tools branch**.

## Task C. Perform code review and merge changes

> For advice on best practices when it comes to code reviews, see the [documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/code_review.html).

1. Navigate to the `Draft: Add performance tools to Family Budget Calculator documentation` merge request by clicking on the red GitLab button in the bottom left corner of the Web IDE, and then clicking **Go to Family Budget Calculator project on GitLab**.

1. Click on **Code > Merge Requests**, and then click on `Draft: Add performance tools to Family Budget Calculator documentation`.

1. On the merge request page, click the **Changes** tab to see the changes that will be applied to the project's **main** branch after merge.

    > Code reviewers can critique individual lines of code and suggest changes. See the [documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/reviews/) to learn more.

1. Click on the **Overview** tab.

1. In the three dots menu to the right of the merge request title, click **Mark as ready** to take the merge request out of draft mode. You will see that **Draft:** has been removed from the merge request's title.

1. Click **Approve** to approve the merge request. Note that the **Merge** button now appears since all requisite approvals have been applied.

1. Scroll down to the comments field and type a comment in the comments field that reads: `Approved. Ready to merge.`. Click **Comment** to post the comment.

1. Click **Merge** and observe the merge complete successfully.

1. Navigate to the project landing page by clicking the **Family Budget Calculator** title tile in the top left corner. See that the `README.md` file on the **main** branch now includes your updates.

1. In the left pane, click **Code > Merge requests**. The merge request will now appear under the **Merged** tab on this page.

## Task D. Create a wiki for project documentation

> If you don't want to keep your documentation in your repository, but you want to keep it in the same project as your code, you can use the wiki GitLab provides in each GitLab project. Every wiki is a separate Git repository, so you can create wiki pages in the web interface, or locally using Git. GitLab wikis support Markdown, Rdoc, AsciiDoc, and Org for content. Wiki pages written in Markdown support all Markdown features, and also provide some wiki-specific behavior for links. You can read more about wikis [here](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/wiki/).

1. Navigate to your **Family Budget Calculator** project in the **Software > Core** subgroup.

1. In the left pane, click **Plan > Wiki**.

1. Click **Create your first page** button in the middle of the page.

1. In the **Title** section, type in `Family Budget Calculator Documentation` as the page title.

1. Paste the following text in the content field underneath the title field.

    ```markdown
    ## Summary

    The Family Budget Calculator helps households stay on budget and save for the future.

    ## Contact

    Contact <your-name> with questions or comments.
    ```

1. Click **Create Page**. You should see a new Wiki page with the content you created.

> If you'd like, edit the **Family Budget Calculator Documentation** page to add additional content or create additional wiki pages.

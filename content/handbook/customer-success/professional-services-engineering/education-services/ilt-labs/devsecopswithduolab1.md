## Objectives

GitLab Duo allows you to use AI-assisted features across GitLab. To get started with GitLab Duo, you will need to first generate a lab environment to work in. This lab environment will provide you with all the GitLab Duo features demonstrated in this course.

## Task A. Working with GitLab Duo Chat

1. Navigate to your GitLab group.

1. Select **Create new project**.

1. Select **Create blank project**.

1. In the project name, type `Duo Demo`.

1. Leave all other options as default and select **Create project**.

1. From your project, click the **GitLab Duo Chat** button in the top right corner.

1. A new chat window will appear on the right side of the screen. Try asking some questions and see how the GitLab Duo responds!

Here are a few demo questions you can ask Duo:

- `How do I move an issue from one project to another?`
- `What is a merged results pipeline?`
- `What is an example of a simple Python function?`

## Task B. Using GitLab Duo Agentic Chat

GitLab Duo Agentic chat can perform tasks for you, such as moving issues or moving merge requests between projects. Let's try it out!

1. If your Duo Chat is not currently open, click the **GitLab Duo Chat** button in the top right corner.

1. Select the **Agentic Chat (Beta)** option in the bottom right.

1. Let's try making an issue. Type in something like, `Create an issue in this project that describes in detail how a team can implement a new security feature to improve their systems.`

1. The GitLab Agentic chat will ask you to Approve of the workflow item. Click **Approve** to continue the action.

1. Once the action is complete, you will see the issue created in your project. Refresh your Issues page to see the new issue.

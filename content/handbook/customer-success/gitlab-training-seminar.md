## Problem to Solve

Do any of these common pain points describe the situation at your company?

- Teams have varying knowledge of GitLab capabilities, making it challenging to define best practices and leverage the features at scale.
- Rigidity in the size of trainings, audience selection, and content does not allow you to effectively enable your large team without compromising your current business objectives.
- Your diverse team has specific areas of the platform they want to go in-depth to be more equipped to enable the business.
- Trainings without a schedule, GitLab expert, wide audience range, and/or regular cadence leads to conflicting understandings of core Duo features and how it can have the most positive impact on your company.

The GitLab Training - Seminar service addresses these challenges by allowing you to select up to 50 participants to work closely with a GitLab Technical Instructor to upskill your workforce.

---

_This guide is primarily for existing GitLab Services and Reseller Partners. Prospective channel partners should learn about GitLab partner programs and sign up [here](/handbook/resellers/)._

## Introduction

 This handbook serves as a companion to the program definitions, guidelines, and key information found in the [GitLab Channel Program](/handbook/resellers/channel-program-guide/) and Incentive Guides. It contains step-by-step processes for the most commonly used GitLab partner program elements, including:

- Partner portal registration and access
- Deal registrations
- Transacting GitLab products (quotes, orders, etc.)
- Service registrations
- Not for Resale (NFR) licenses
- Partner marketing resources

 ---

### Partner Portal Registration

#### First-Time Setup

Professionals from authorized GitLab channel partner organizations can register for portal access in a few simple steps:

1. Visit the [GitLab Partner Portal](https://partners.gitlab.com/)
2. Select "Register" in the top right corner
3. Confirm your organization affiliation
4. Click "Next" and complete your information
5. Submit the form to receive login credentials

**Need help?** Contact partnersupport@gitlab.com with any questions or issues.

#### Portal Resources

Once logged in, partners can access valuable resources including:

- Partner registration and account management
- Deal registration and opportunity management
- Training accreditation and learning modules
- Sales, services, program, and marketing resources
- GitLab news, communications, and program announcements

For detailed navigation instructions, visit the [Partner Portal Guide](https://partners.gitlab.com/prm/api/objects/v1/asset/hugkbmggdhtg/_view).

#### Partner Locator Profile

Once registered as a partner, partners should update their profile on the Partner Locator. This tool is used by GitLab prospects, customers, and field teams to find partners in specific regions and territories. The Partner Locator also captures leads from customers seeking partner information and routes them accordingly.

Partners should provide detailed information about their capabilities, alliances, locations, and success stories. For profile update instructions, visit the [Partner Locator Guide](https://partners.gitlab.com/prm/api/objects/v1/asset/s59lwfbsrlx9/_view).

---

### Training and Certifications

GitLab training programs are available through the [GitLab Partner Portal](https://partners.gitlab.com/) by visiting GitLab University. Partners will find accreditation courses and testing required to meet GitLab program requirements for sales, pre-sales, technical, and professional services training.

Visit the [Channel Partner Training and Certifications](/handbook/resellers/training/) handbook page for additional information, including different accreditation requirements for Open Partner and Select Partner tracks.

---

### Deal Registration Program Overview

To promote partner growth and profitability, manage channel conflict, and provide a systematic approach to pursuing sales opportunities, GitLab has formalized deal registration procedures. Partners in the GitLab Partner Program must register individual sales opportunities (not customer accounts or combined opportunities).

#### Definitions and Qualifications

The Deal Registration definitions, eligibility, qualifications, and margin incentives can be found in the [GitLab Partner Program Guide](https://partners.gitlab.com/prm/api/objects/v1/asset/vtktpfdn20l5/_view).

#### Key Guidelines

- **Approval Process**: Deal registration approval is based on order of receipt, opportunity qualification, partner ability to deliver in-country/region support, and partner relationship with the customer
- **Exclusivity**: Only one partner can earn deal registration margin per opportunity
- **Eligibility**: New or existing customer opportunities, new opportunities with existing customers, and add-on sales to renewals can qualify
- **Expiration**: Approved deal registrations have a standard 90-day expiration from approval date
- **Requirements**: Only authorized partners with signed GitLab Partner Program Agreements can register deals. At least one partner employee must complete GitLab Foundations for Partners training

#### Submitting a Deal Registration

#### Deal Registration Instructions

1. Go to the [GitLab Partner Portal](https://partners.gitlab.com/) and select "Deals"
2. Choose "Add a Registration"
3. Select "GitLab" from the vendor list
4. Choose your program type:
   1. **Deal Registration**: For standard licensing sales (Referral, Resale, or MSP)
   2. **Service Attached Registration**: For services delivery rebate program participation
5. Complete all required information thoroughly
6. Select "Submit the deal"
7. Proceed through the review and approval process

#### Partner Sourced Deal Registration Rules of Engagement

1. Submitted registrations are routed to Ecosystem Operations for review
2. Ecosystem Ops creates a new opportunity or links the existing opportunity to the registration

- **If an opportunity does not yet exist**
  - Ecosystem Ops approves the deal registration and creates the opportunity
- **If an opportunity exists in stages 0 through 2**
  - Ecosystem Ops links the opportunity and routes it to the ESM for approval
  - If the ESM approves, the registration routes to the ASM for final approval
  - If the ASM does not approve within 10 days, Ecosystem Ops approves the registration
- **If an opportunity exists in stages 3 through 6**
  - Ecosystem Ops reviews the Sales Last Activity Date field
  - If Sales Activity is present, Ecosystem Ops denies the registration
  - If the opportunity has aged > 180 days since the last activity, Ecosystem Ops approves the registration
  - If the opportunity is a renewal with sourced growth, Ecosystem Ops routes it to the ESM for approval
    - If the ESM approves, the registration routes to the ASM for approval
    - If the registration is not approved within 10 days of submission, Ecosystem Ops approves the registration

### Service Attached Registrations

#### How Service Attached Registrations Work

Service attached registrations are for professional or advisory services that partners deliver for GitLab customers. These registrations may qualify for quarterly rebates and help meet Professional Services Partner program compliance requirements.

The partner does not have to be the GitLab license seller of record and only one service attach registration qualifies per opportunity.  Each SOW can only be applied to one Service Attached Registration (i.e., one SOW cannot be used for multiple registrations). However, exceptions may be considered on a case-by-case basis for multi-phase projects that drive an add-on or upsell opportunity. An overview of the Service Attach program and available incentives are available in the [GitLab Partner Program Guide](https://partners.gitlab.com/prm/api/objects/v1/asset/vtktpfdn20l5/_view).

#### Qualification Categories

1. **License Key Deployment** (default): Customer receives download link and accepts terms to get key
2. **Physical Signature**: Fully countersigned document for customers requiring it

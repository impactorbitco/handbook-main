## GitLab Services and Resale Partner Program Guide

This guide documents the components, benefits and requirements of the GitLab Partner Program. For existing partners that require detailed information on how to work with GitLab on transactions, enablement and program elements, please refer to the [Working with GitLab page](/handbook/resellers/channel-working-with-gitlab/) of the GitLab Handbook.

### The GitLab Ecosystem Strategy

The GitLab Ecosystem strategy is to collaborate with ecosystem partners across the customer lifecycle. By bringing together GitLab and partners across the globe, we are able to deliver the greatest value to customers and prospects. This collaboration brings together:

1. Regional, national and global professional services and integration partners
2. Hyperscaler partners, including Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud
3. Regional and national resale partners and distributors
4. Technology partners offering integrations to expand solution capabilities

To drive alignment around this customer focused approach, GitLab offers the GitLab Partner Program for our professional services and resale partners. The program focuses on rewarding partners for value delivered rather than volume. We offer partners enablement and resources to prepare them for success no matter where they engage in the customer journey.

### The Opportunity of Partnering with GitLab

The most successful GitLab partners take a consultative, outcome-based approach with their customer and prospect engagements. Quite often, new GitLab partners are adding DevSecOps to their existing/adjacent app modernization, digital transformation, and/or hyperscaler practices.

#### Why DevSecOps?

DevSecOps is a large market with significant favorable trends. The DevSecOps Total Available Market (TAM) is estimated to be $40b, based on a GitLab internal assessment of market data.  This represents both the software and services opportunity that partners can pursue together with GitLab.

in 2023.”_ Source: Gartner®, Optimize Your Selection of DevOps Toolchains and Platforms, Hassan Ennaciri, Chris Saunderson, Manjunath Bhat, Daniel

#### Why GitLab?

GitLab enables our customers to deliver better, more secure software faster with one platform for their entire software delivery lifecycle. Customers can boost efficiency and reduce cycle times of every user with the help of AI in every phase of the software development lifecycle - from planning and code creation to testing, security, and monitoring.

GitLab customers gain clear & measurable benefits like 7x faster cycle times, along with improved uptimes, scalability, and security postures. Enterprise customers see over 400% ROI, as documented in the [Forrester® Consulting GitLab Ultimate's total economic impact](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2024/11/13/gitlab-ultimates-total-economic-impact-483-roi-over-3-years/) report.  GitLab named a Leader in the [2024 Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ for DevOps Platforms](https://about.gitlab.com/gartner-magic-quadrant/) for the second consecutive year and also a Leader in the [2024 Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ for AI Code Assistants](https://about.gitlab.com/gartner-mq-ai-code-assistants/).

#### Building a Successful Business with GitLab

GitLab focuses on working with partners who offer value-added DevSecOps Professionals Services to our joint customers, creating an opportunity for building profitable service practices that leverage GitLab as a strategic element to onboard customers and support their DevSecOps practices across technology stacks. The GitLab Ecosystem of partners is positioned to grow revenue through:

- Professional services including implementations, migrations, integrations, managed services, training and DevOps optimization for customers. Also, GitLab aligns to broader opportunities such as app modernization, cloud migration and digital transformation initiatives.
- Rebates for partners delivering their own services to our customers. This helps our customers with deployment and adoption, and offers partners an additional source of services revenue and investment funds.
- Annual GitLab software subscription resale margins. With the GitLab platform, partners can create a foundation for add on product sales as well as long-term recurring revenue.
- Referrals for identifying new GitLab subscription opportunities.
- Marketplace transactions through the AWS and/or GCP marketplaces, enabling partners to deliver broader, more integrated offerings with the hyperscalers and GitLab.

#### Deal Registration Program

To promote the growth and success of channel partners, manage channel conflict, and provide a systematic approach to pursuing sales opportunities, GitLab has formalized rules of engagement and deal registration procedures. Partners are encouraged to submit their deal registrations as early as possible to lock in the largest program margin. Deal registrations must be for an individual sales opportunity, not an account or combined opportunities.

Only partners that have signed the GitLab Partner Program Agreement and are in compliance with program requirements are able to register deals, earn program margins and transact with GitLab. Unauthorized partners do not qualify. If at least one partner employee completes the Sales Professional accreditation, a partner may temporarily qualify for deal registration and program margins.

For detailed deal registration rules and transactional instructions, please visit the [Working with GitLab page](/handbook/resellers/channel-working-with-gitlab/#deal-registration-program-overview) in the GitLab Handbook.

#### Service Attached Registration Program

- Integration with other tools in the customer’s DevSecOps toolchain
- Migration from other DevSecOps tools
- DevOps optimization and transformation - creating scalable, repeatable and efficient DevOps processes
- Managed/hosted services (with software sold to / owned by end customer)
- Security and compliance, helping customers integrate security earlier in the development process and to meet industry compliance requirements
- Adoption workshops and advisory

- Application Development
- DevSecOps AI integration
- Support and/or Success Services

Another benefit of service attach registrations is that they help meet partners’ Professional Services Program (PSP) compliance and help the GitLab Sales and Services teams learn more about partner capabilities and customers. This makes it easier to match customer services needs to partner’s capabilities.

To qualify for the rebate incentive, Select partners and/or PSPs must submit a qualifying Service Attach deal registrations. This is separate from the Partner Sourced Deal Registration for the license sale. Partners with approved Service Attached Registrations qualify for quarterly back-end rebates. In addition, approved and accepted Service Attached Registrations count towards partners' PSP qualifications.

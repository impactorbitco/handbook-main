## Company-Wide Leave of Absence Policies

GitLab's leave policies are intended to provide team members time away from work to care for themselves as they recover from a serious health condition, care for a family member recovering from a serious health condition, to bond with a newborn or a newly placed child for adoption, to serve in the military, etc.

Your Absence Managment team is here to help before, during, or after your leave. If you have any questions related to your time away after reviewing this page, please contact the Absence Management team in HelpLab to discuss or request a 1:1 with the Absence Management team.

This page is designed to educate our team members about the different GitLab-specific leave policies available.  Whenever allowed by law these leave programs are coordinated and run concurrently any entity specific leaves a team member may be eligible for.

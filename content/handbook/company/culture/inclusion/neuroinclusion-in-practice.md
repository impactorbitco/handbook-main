## NeuroInclusion in Practice

## Design for every way of thinking

At GitLab, neuroinclusion is part of how we live our [CREDIT values](/handbook/values/).  
When we design our systems and communication for every way of thinking, everyone benefits — collaboration improves, innovation strengthens, and all team members can thrive.

This page introduces the **NeuroInclusion in Practice** learning series and connects you to related resources, community spaces, and support.

## Key Principles

These principles align with GitLab’s [CREDIT values](/handbook/values/) — especially Collaboration, Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging, and Results.

- **Design for every brain — everyone benefits**  
  Designing systems and processes that consider different ways of thinking supports collaboration and innovation across all teams.

- **Barriers live in systems, not people**  
  Inclusion focuses on improving environments and processes rather than expecting individuals to adapt to systems that don’t work for them.

- **Clarity and flexibility enable success**  
  Clear expectations combined with adaptable approaches help people work effectively in a global, async environment.

- **Different thinking styles are strengths**  
  Cognitive diversity drives creative problem-solving, innovation, and better outcomes for both teams and customers.

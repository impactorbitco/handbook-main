**Purpose of the TMRG**

The Caregiver TMRG provides a safe space for every GitLab team member to better understand the role of being a caregiver and to build a network of caregivers (including working parents) and their allies at GitLab. This TMRG is non-exclusionary in nature and open to anyone at GitLab.

"There are only four kinds of people in this world: those who have been caregivers, those who are currently caregivers, those who will be caregivers and those who will need caregivers. Caregiving is universal." --  Rosalynn Carter, Former First Lady of the United States

Main objectives for this TMRG:

- Providing peer support to TMRG members through a safe space for learning and sharing lived experience.
- Discussing issues faced by working parents and caregivers, providing insight into potential improvements, and offering support to prospective working parents caregivers.
- Providing advice and recommendations to GitLab on initiatives and activities that may better support the retention and attraction of working parents and caregivers.
- Assisting members of the TMRG, as well as other employees, towards better cultural understanding as it relates to being a working parent or caregiver and the particular demands this creates for the individual.
- Supporting GitLab's inclusive culture strategy, by engaging in local and global initiatives and acting as local inclusion champions who are making a positive difference.

We want to support caregivers in a wide variety of situations, such as:

- Caregivers of children, particularly littles
- Caregivers of children with special needs
- Solo caregivers
- Caregivers of disabled dependents of any age
- End-of-life care

## Member Involvement

This section is meant to outline how team members in the Black@GitLab TMRG can contribute to key initiatives each quarter. We encourage team members to contribute in any way they feel comfortable and have capacity - from meeting attendance to leading initiatives and anywhere in between!

### Contribute to a TMRG key initiative

We use our [GitLab issue board](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/black-tmrg/-/boards) to coordinate and prioritize projects on a quarterly basis. Contribute to the issue board by:

1. Open a new issue to propose an idea or project.
   1. Assign yourself or the TMRG leads to the issue.
   1. `@mention` the TMRG leads in an issue comment.
1. Comment on an open issue, with priority 1 or priority 2 labels with questions, input, or feedback.
1. Contribute to an open issue that is assigned a `~"Black@::Priority::1"` or `~"Black@::Priority::2"` label.

### Events

> **Note**: We're currently [planning recurring events](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/black-tmrg/-/issues/66) for the upcoming year. Watch this space for more info.

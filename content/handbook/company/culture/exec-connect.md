## Exec Connect

Exec Connect is a series of informal, in-person meetups between GitLab leaders and local team members.  
The goal is to build connection, strengthen trust, and create space for open conversation as a way to continually improve our culture.

We heard through engagement surveys and direct feedback that team members want more opportunities to connect with leaders face-to-face.

## Overview

Exec Connect events are 60-minute, in-person gatherings held in locations where leaders are already traveling.  

---

## How It Works

- **Coordination:** EBAs (or other designated DRI) manage logistics; the DIB team provides templates, context, and tracking support.
- **Timing:** "Existing travel through Q1 2026"  
- **Format:** 10 min arrival  |  40 min conversation  |  5 min wrap-up  
- **Budget:** Funded through sponsoring leader and/or DIB (if needed)
- **Attendance:** Open to all team members in the area  
- **Travel reimbursement:** Up to $25 in local currency (e.g., Uber, rail, or local transport) — may vary slightly by location

## Who Can Participate

All team members within approximately 60 minutes of the host city are welcome to attend.  
E-Group members and functional leaders are invited to host at least one event aligned with their existing travel through Q1 2026.

## What to Expect

Exec Connects are informal and conversational.  
There’s no slide deck or formal agenda — just time to talk, ask questions, and share perspectives.  
Leaders often open with a brief reflection or update, then spend the majority of the session in open discussion with attendees.

## How to Host (for Leaders Only)

1. Identify an upcoming trip (Existing travel through Q1 2026).  
2. Partner with your EBA to coordinate a local event (venue, invites, timing).  
3. Review a short context brief about the team members attending.  
4. Show up — no slides or prep required.  
5. Share reflections or insights afterward with your EBA or the DIB team.

## How to Attend (for Team Members)

Invitations will be posted in Slack to team members located within a 60-minute radius of an event.  
To join, RSVP in the Slack thread and come ready to connect and share.

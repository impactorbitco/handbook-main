title: "User Journey Map Working Group"
description: "This working group has been established to develop a strategic framework and supportive infrastructure for scalable, consistent development of user journey maps across the GitLab platform."
---

These maps will enable Product, UX, and Dev teams to understand the complete journey of customers and GitLab users as they discover, evaluate, adopt, and integrate our DevSecOps platform. By identifying friction points, opportunities for education, and moments that matter most to users, we will create seamless pathways that increase first orders, accelerate successful onboarding, and strengthen long-term retention across our customer base.

While this working group focuses on creating a structured foundation for journey maps, there are various initiatives ongoing related to the creation of maps that can be found in the [UX Backlog User Journey Mapping issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/Product/-/issues/14135).

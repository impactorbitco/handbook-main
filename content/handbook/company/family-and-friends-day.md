## What is a Family and Friends Day?

We started our Family & Friends day benefit in early 2020 to help team members cope with the COVID-19 pandemic. We planned to continue Family & Friends days for as long as the majority of the world was dealing with the pandemic. While the World Health Organization declared an [end to the COVID-19 global health emergency](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/who-ends-covid-global-health-emergency-rcna83046) in early 2023, we have maintained Family & Friends days as a team member benefit with different iterations each fiscal year.

Team members are encouraged to share about their Family and Friends day in the `#family-and-friends-day` Slack channel after the event, or publicly on social media such as Twitter, LinkedIn, or wherever they're most comfortable using the hashtag #FamilyFriends1st. Sharing is optional. Taking the day off is strongly encouraged if your role allows it.

## FY'26 Family and Friends Days

In FY25, we chose one day a quarter to recognize a Family & Friends day. In FY26, we plan to consolidate those 4 Family & Friends days near the end of the calendar year. Keeping our Friends & Family day benefit at a time when our customers are often away from work, and during a quieter time in the year, will allow us to best serve our customers and meet our business objectives.

The proposed dates for FY26 Family & Friends days are:

1. 2025-12-26
1. 2025-12-29
1. 2025-12-30
1. 2025-12-31

Family & Friends days will be automatically loaded into Workday by end of Q1FY26, for all team members, so there's no need for team members to enter them manually.

In countries where a Family & Friends day falls on a public holiday, team members are encouraged to [utilize their public holiday on another day](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c0Qp738HXEeIb_SxUeKZYlG3su086CO5Dxa618Rvffk/edit?usp=sharing), keeping in mind that the public holiday accrual balance needs to be used within the same calendar year.

For example, if the Family & Friends day on 2025-12-26 is a public holiday in your country, create a new absence request in Workday for the public holiday on another day _within the same calendar year_, such as 2025-12-24, by selecting `Type of Absence > Time Offs > Public Holiday`, and add a note that you are using your public holiday on this day because 2025-12-26 is a public holiday in your location which falls on one of GitLab's Family & Friends days.

- In Israel, Family & Friends days will be adjusted to 2025-12-28, 2025-12-29, 2025-12-30, and 2025-12-31.

As with years past, team members in roles that require them to work on a date designated as a Family & Friends day can work with their manager to find an alternative day. Team members in roles that require them to work on a date designated as a Family & Friends day will be able to request the alternative(s) day in Workday (or via the Workday link in Slack).

- Choose a day that works best for your manager and your team. Please note: The alternative date should be within 30 days (before or after) of the scheduled Family & Friends day.
- Log into Workday and request time off using the category "Time Off in Lieu", reason “Family and Friends Day”.
- In the comments section, please note: "In lieu of Family and Friends Day on XXX".
- This will route to your manager for approval.

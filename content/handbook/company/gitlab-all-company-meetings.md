## Overview

GitLab has three big quarterly internal-only meetings to align team members on key happenings and priorities across the business. The first is the Quarterly Kickoff, the next is the Post-Earnings Recap & AMA, and the last is Assembly. This page provides an overview of each of these.

## Timing

Timing of team member touchpoints:

- [Earnings Call](/handbook/finance/investor-relations/#quarterly-earnings-process) (first half of the second month of the quarter): Public call that team members are invited to attend
- [Post-Earnings Recap & AMA](#post-earnings-recap--ama) (immediately following earnings): A 25 minute private AMA occurring after Earnings
- [Assembly](/handbook/people-group/employment-branding/people-communications/#gitlab-assembly) (end of second month, early the third month of a quarter): An all-company meeting occurring 3-4 weeks after Earnings that covers a wide range of topics

### Provident Fund and National Pension Scheme

#### Provident Fund

GitLab contributes to team member’s Provident Funds, which is outlined in your employment agreement. It ensures retirement benefits and family pensions on death in service.

- Member Contribution(% of base salary):
  - EPF: 3.67% and EPS: 8.33%, Total Contribution: 12%
- Employer Contribution(% of base salary):
  - EPF: 12%, EPS: None

Team members will declare their desired provident fund contributions (up to salary ceiling or actual compensation) during onboarding.

<details markdown="1">

<summary>Reducing PF Contributions</summary>

Team members select their Provident Fund election when they join GitLab. If you initially elected to cap your PF contribution, you cannot request to increase it later. If you elected 12% PF contributions, you may request to reduce to the capped amount during the April enrollment period, however please note: this will reduce both employer matching contributions and your overall CTC. Your 'fixed compensation' component will remain unchanged and will not be adjusted to offset the reduction.

To request a reduction, submit a formal written request via [HelpLab](https://helplab.gitlab.systems/esc) acknowledging the impact to your CTC and employer contributions prior to April 6th to reflect the change in the next Tax year.

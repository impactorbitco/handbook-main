## Introduction

There is a directory for team members employed through a GitLab entity to locate [employment-related policies specific to their country of residence](/handbook/people-policies/#entity-specific-employment-policies) included with the team member policies listed on the ['People Policies' page](/handbook/people-policies/) of the handbook. These policies do not supersede [GitLab Inc.'s Code of Business Conduct & Ethics](https://ir.gitlab.com/governance/governance-documents/default.aspx).

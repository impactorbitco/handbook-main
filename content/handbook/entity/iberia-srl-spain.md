Any changes to contract templates should be requested through Legal, Employment and will require approval from our Senior Director of Legal, Employment. The DRI for all individual GitLab team member contracts is the People Operations Team and individual contract copies are lodged with the Spanish Labour Inspectorate by the payroll provider (Papaya) as required. Contact nonuspayroll@gitlab.com if you have any queries.

### Collective Bargaining Agreement

The XIX Convenio colectivo estatal de empresas de consultor√≠a, tecnolog√≠as de la informaci√≥n y estudios de mercado y de la opini√≥n p√∫blica applies at GitLab and the July 2025 version can be found [here](https://www.boe.es/boe/dias/2025/04/16/pdfs/BOE-A-2025-7766.pdf).

### Important Policies

* [People Policies](/handbook/people-policies/) \- Directory of relevant policies with Spanish translations available for reference purposes [here](/handbook/people-policies/#translations)  
* [Legal Policies](/handbook/legal/#gitlab-policies) \- Spanish translations available for reference purposes [here](/handbook/people-policies/#translations)
* Daily time logging required (mandatory by Spanish law)  
* Monthly timesheet submission by 2nd of following month

* Submit through HelpLab (Payroll ‚Üí Timecards)

## Timekeeping Policies

It is mandatory for every Spanish company to register the working day of its employees and these timekeeping records must be kept for four years.

Trust-based working time generally refers to a GitLab's way of working, a flexible working time model in which team members can independently decide on the location and timing (i.e. beginning and end) of their work day. GitLab trusts that team members will fulfill their work obligations. A documentation of working hours does not stand in the way of such an agreement. This documentation does serve to protect the safety and health of employees and ensure rest is taken.

### Timekeeping Record

As of May 1, 2024 each team member employed by GitLab Iberia will be required to log the start and end of their daily work time. We have provided a Google spreadsheet template, in English or Spanish. This record will be kept by Payroll and can be audited at any time.

### Daily Work Time

Team members will render their services on a full-time basis and the annual working hours at GitLab will be in accordance with applicable legislation and the applicable CBA.

### Rest Policy

Between work days, team members are entitled to an uninterrupted rest period of 12 hours. Additionally team members are entitled to a weekly rest period of 1.5 uninterrupted days (usually taken on weekends).

### Overtime

Overtime, if appropriate, *must be expressly and previously authorized in writing by GitLab*. If GitLab has *not* required or authorized overtime work, then team members should not exceed the normal daily working hours and such time worked in excess will not be considered overtime for any purposes.

## Timesheets

Team members will be expected to fill out a monthly timesheet at the end of each month. The timesheet template can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KFUjpX1T2EBLqsi2c6jauI7odIiu9WXF) and either the English or Spanish version can be used.

We use the following research tools.

## Research Tools We Use and How to Get Access

- [RallyUXR](https://app.rallyuxr.com/gitlab/studies)- Main recruitment and panel management tool, which also offers external participant recruitment (via Respondent.io)
- [User Interviews](https://www.userinterviews.com/) - Alternative for moderated/unmoderated sessions when RallyUXR isn't sufficient
- [Qualtrics](https://gitlab.eu.qualtrics.com/) - Complex surveys with advanced logic
- [Dovetail](https://gitlab.dovetail.com/) - Data analysis, insights collaboration, and research repository
- [Optimal Workshop](https://www.optimalworkshop.com/) - Card sorting and tree testing (pay on demand)
- [UserTesting.com](http://UserTesting.com) - Unmoderated testing with audio/video capture
- [Figjam](http://figma.com) - Online brainstorming and synthesis

UX practitioners will have access to some of these tools as their role entitlement when they join the company. **Anyone can browse and request access to new tools via [Lumos](https://app.lumosidentity.com/app_store)**. If the tool you are looking for is not in Lumos yet, you can [open an access request](/handbook/security/corporate/end-user-services/access-requests/). Note, we purchase individual monthly passes for Optimal Workshop on demand, you need to open a procurement issue ([example](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/Finance-Division/procurement-team/procurement/-/issues/1596)) /instead.

## Tool Selection Guide

Note there are many ways to tackle a research problem. Below are some basic suggestions. When in doubt, check with a UX Researcher by posting your question in the [#ux_research](https://gitlab.enterprise.slack.com/archives/CMEERUCE4) channel.

**For participant recruitment and management**

- Use [RallyUXR](https://app.rallyuxr.com/gitlab/home) as your primary tool for recruitment, panel management, scheduling, and incentive processing across all user research.
  - [RallyUXR](https://app.rallyuxr.com/gitlab/studies) is already connected to most of the tools and databases we use for research. If additional setup is needed for your study, the ReOps team will let you know.
  - Leverage their **external panel option** (powered by [Respondent.io](http://Respondent.io)) when you can't recruit enough participants through our existing user base in RallyUXR.
  - Use [User Interviews](https://www.userinterviews.com/researcher) only when looking for participants with diverse accessibility needs, when you need non-GitLab users or RallyUXR cannot fulfill your participant quota.

**For scheduling and sessions.**

- RallyUXR is the tool for this too. Make sure your [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/r) and [Zoom](https://gitlab.zoom.us/) are connected with your RallyUXR account.

**For surveys**

- Use [Qualtrics](https://gitlab.eu.qualtrics.com/) for **complex surveys** where skip logic and display logic is necessary. It offers a diverse array of question types, and is best for surveys that require dozens to hundreds of participants.
  - Example = USAT+, first click tests, screener surveys.
- User [Google Forms](https://docs.google.com/forms/) for more **straightforward surveys**, with no complex logic needs. It’s more mobile friendly too.
  - Example = internal research, team health, diary study entries.
- Use [UserTesting.com](http://UserTesting.com) for small **qualitative and unmoderated usability testing**, between 5 to 8 users, when you need video responses to dive deep into the hows and whys.
  - Example = design direction exploration, prototype interaction

**For usability testing**

- For **moderated 1:1** or group sessions, use [Zoom](https://gitlab.zoom.us/), and upload the recordings to [Dovetail](https://gitlab.dovetail.com/), for analysis and record keeping.
- For **unmoderated usability sessions**, use [UserTesting.com](http://UserTesting.com), but bear in mind that is still a tool for small scale projects, with 5 - 8 participants, and not suitable for extensive testing.

**For In-Depth Interviews**

- Use [Zoom](https://gitlab.zoom.us/), and upload the recordings to [Dovetail](https://gitlab.dovetail.com/) for analysis and record keeping.

**For card-sorting and tree-testing**

- For unmoderated and closed card sort:
  - Use [Qualtrics](https://gitlab.eu.qualtrics.com/) for larger samples
  - Use [UserTesting.com](http://UserTesting.com) for smaller samples or when video is needed
- For open card sort and tree-testing, coordinate with Research Operations ([#ux_research_operations](https://gitlab.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C03SW7KPA1X)) to arrange an on demand subscription of [Optimal Workshop](https://www.optimalworkshop.com/).

**For diary studies**

- The team *is still looking into a definitive tool for diary studies*. At the moment, we have a mix and match of methodologies.
- Use [Qualtrics](https://gitlab.eu.qualtrics.com/), or [Google Forms](https://docs.google.com/forms/) for text-based diary study
- [Google Forms](https://docs.google.com/forms/) is better for collecting simple daily feedback
  - Both [Qualtrics](https://gitlab.eu.qualtrics.com/) and [Google Forms](https://docs.google.com/forms/) allow participants to submit screen captures too.
- For video diary entries, [UserTesting.com](http://UserTesting.com) is the best option.

**For co-creation**

- Use [Figjam](https://www.figma.com/figjam/) for online brainstorming, synthesis, and collaboration.
  - Be sure to grant the participant access to the board before the session.

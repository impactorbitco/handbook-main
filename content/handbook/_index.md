## Introduction

The Impact Orbit Creative Group Handbook is the central repository for how we operate.  
Printed, it contains extensive guidance, policies, and best practices for the organisation.  

In the spirit of transparency, much of the handbook is [open to the world](https://github.com/impactorbitco/handbook-main).  
We welcome feedback — please submit a [pull request](https://github.com/impactorbitco/handbook-main) for improvements or clarifications, or open an issue for questions.

For sensitive internal information, we maintain a separate Internal Handbook.

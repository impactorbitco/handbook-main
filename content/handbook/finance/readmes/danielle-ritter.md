## Why I'm at GitLab

The people you work with day in and day out are so important to the experiences one has in their career.  I'm impressed by the transparency and collaboration amongst the people at GitLab, and the structure in which we operate.
As an Internal Audit leader, I've worked places where audit is seen as a necessary evil or a compliance checkbox. At GitLab, I found people who actually get it: that managing risk well and continuously improving operations makes the entire company stronger. That cultural alignment matters deeply to me.

## My Personal Values

- **There is always room to evolve** - continuous improvement and efficiency personally and professionally
- **Partnership over policing** - Internal audit should be trusted business partner and value driver
- **Integrity** - be honest, do what you say you will do, and don’t be a jerk
- **Life experiences are as important as work** - Make time for personal well-being alongside professional excellence (this is a work in progress for me)

## My Super Powers - how you can get the best from me

- **I find efficiency opportunities** - I naturally spot ways to make processes easier and more efficient (it's never from negativity, always from a continuous improvement mindset)
- **I bridge the gap between tech and business** - With my IT technical background, I translate technology speak into business context, especially around risk and compliance
- **Problem solving** - i love to collaborate and solve complex problems. Let’s work together to make things better

## My Weaknesses

- **I can be too direct** - Sometimes my directness comes across as harsh when that's not my intention. Please call it out if something lands wrong - I'm actively working on this
- **I overanalyze** - Sometimes I spend too much time trying to make things "perfect" or contemplating alternative approaches
- **Work-life balance is a journey** - I'm still figuring out how to balance being my best self at work and at home, especially as a mom. I don't have it all figured out yet

## My Expectations of Everyone

- Trust the audit partnership - We're not here to police or find "gotchas" - we're extra arms and legs to help design solutions and validate processes
- Transparency about risks and inefficiencies - Share what you see across the organization - it helps me help you
- Try your best and work hard, but take time for yourself.  You are only as productive at work as you are mentally ready to work
- Share your perspective. You’re here for a reason and your inputs are valuable

## My Role

1. VP Internal Audit - My team operates in three core pillars:

    - Operational audits - advisory or assurance projects
    - Enterprise risk management - facilitates the company wide ERM program and works with leadership to building
    - SOX compliance validation - testing of controls to support mgmt’s SOX conclusions

1. I'm your advocate for:

    - Managing risks in our operations and strategy
    - Continuous improvement and efficiency
    - Helping business leaders validate that risk management processes are operating as intended
    - Creating solutions when processes aren't working as designed
    - Providing an objective, valuable perspective worth your time

## Communication Preferences

- **Preferred method of comm**: slack
- **Channels**: slack, email, text, phone calls all welcome
- **Urgency**: If urgent, call or text my cell
- **Meetings**: please leverage my amazing EBA, Sarah Hobbs to help get time on my calendar. Even if it doesn’t seem like I have time, feel free to reach out via slack or email. I will always make time for important matters and I LOVE to help folks with career advice
- **Direct feedback welcome**: I'll share my perspective directly and want to understand yours. Blunt is better than unsaid
- **Work hours**: West Coast USA (PST). I check in around 6:30-7am, support my kids' morning routine, then at my desk 8-9am PST

## Expectations for leadership - What I need from you. What you will get from me

- Given our remote environment, engagement amongst our team in slack channels is important to me.  Be present in the spaces our team works
- Transparency  - don’t avoid sharing information with me because my team is Internal Audit; or don’t avoid sharing something that concerns you because of my staff level. I will always give you as much information as I’m able
- I like understanding context, so I often provide background to my asks or perspectives. I appreciate the same
- I will support you the best I can, be open and honest and I’ll do the same
- I will be a trusted partner you can put on speed dial for an objective perspective
- I’m an advocate who will always do my best to help you grow - in your career, project success, or beyond

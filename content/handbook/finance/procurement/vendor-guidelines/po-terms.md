title: "PURCHASE ORDER TERMS AND CONDITIONS"
---

## 1. AGREEMENT & ACCEPTANCE

1.1 This Purchase Order ("Order") constitutes GitLab's offer to purchase Products and/or Services according to the terms and conditions set forth herein. "Services" means actions provided by Vendor, Vendor Personnel or Vendor Subcontractor as governed by this Order. "Products" are goods or products purchased by GitLab and provided by Vendor. Vendor's acknowledgment, commencement of performance, or delivery of Products/Services constitutes acceptance of these exact terms without modification.

1.2 GitLab explicitly rejects any additional or different terms provided by Vendor, including but not limited to terms in quotes, invoices, product packaging ("shrink wrap terms"), online interfaces ("click wrap terms" or "browse wrap terms"), or any other writing or oral communication, unless agreed to in writing by an authorized GitLab signer, by hand, in ink.

## 2. DELIVERY & ACCEPTANCE

2.1 Time is of the essence for delivery of all Products and Services. Delivery shall be strictly in accordance with schedules in this Order. GitLab may cancel all or any portion of this Order, and reject any/all Products upon Vendor's default for any delay or missed delivery milestone by providing a written Termination Notice. Upon cancellation, GitLab shall only pay for Products/Services provided and accepted prior to termination. Any prepayments for undelivered items shall be refunded within 30 days from the Termination Notice date.

2.2 Vendor shall notify the GitLab contact specified on the first page of this Order for authorization to proceed if Vendor cannot meet specified delivery dates.

2.3 Products ship FOB destination. Title and risk of loss pass to GitLab with written proof of delivery and acceptance at the listed delivery address. No air deliveries without GitLab's written authorization. Vendor shall assume differential shipping costs if alternate shipping methods are necessary to meet delivery dates.

2.4 Delivery is complete only when Products have been documented as received and accepted by an authorized GitLab employee at the designated premises, notwithstanding any agreement to pay freight or transportation charges. Acceptance of Products/Services is subject to GitLab's inspection and rejection rights and shall not waive GitLab's right to cancel or return Products due to non-conformity, defects, or warranty breach. Prior payment does not constitute final acceptance, and rejected items shall not be replaced without GitLab's specific written authorization.

3.3 This warranty provision survives inspection, delivery, acceptance, payment, expiration or termination of this Order. Warranties run to GitLab, its successors, assigns, employees, and users of Products/Services.

3.4 Vendor shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless GitLab, their affiliates and each of their shareholders, members, directors, officers, managers, employees, customers, partners, representatives, and agents including contractors and subcontractors from any third-party claims, demands, and liability for damages, losses, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising from: a) Acts/omissions by Vendor, Vendor Personnel or Vendor's Subcontractors in performance or delivery; b) Death, bodily injury, or property damage due to Vendor negligence or misconduct; c) Violation of third-party intellectual property rights; d) Breach of representations, warranties, or obligations; e) Failure to pay Vendor Personnel; or f) Claims by Vendor Personnel, governmental entities, or third parties related to employment or consulting relationships.

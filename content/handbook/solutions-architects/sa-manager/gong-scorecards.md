## Introduction

This page provides comprehensive guidance for Solutions Architect (SA) managers on effectively using Gong Scorecards to review, evaluate, and coach their team members. The goal is to create a structured approach to performance improvement that maintains trust, fosters growth, and enhances customer interactions.

## Understanding Gong Scorecards

### What Are Gong Scorecards?

Gong Scorecards are evaluation tools that assess the quality and effectiveness of recorded customer calls. They provide a framework for measuring specific behaviors, skills, and outcomes during customer interactions. Scorecards help standardize evaluation criteria and ensure consistent feedback across the team.

### AI-Powered Scoring with Human Oversight

Gong's AI technology automatically analyzes recorded calls and provides initial scoring based on predefined criteria. However, human judgment remains essential for:

- **Contextual understanding:** AI may miss nuanced situations or customer-specific contexts
- **Accuracy validation:** Managers should review AI scores to ensure they align with actual performance
- **Customization:** Human reviewers can adjust scores based on factors the AI might not fully capture
- **Coaching opportunities:** Managers can identify specific areas for improvement that require human insight

**Key Process:**

1. Gong AI provides initial automated scoring
2. Managers review AI-generated scores and call highlights
3. Managers make adjustments based on their judgment and additional context
4. Final scores are used for coaching and performance discussions

## Goal and Positive Intention for Solutions Architects

### The Purpose Behind Scorecards

For Solutions Architects, scorecards are designed to:

- **Accelerate professional development:** Identify strengths to leverage and areas for improvement
- **Enhance customer outcomes:** Improve the quality of customer interactions and technical guidance
- **Standardize excellence:** Create consistent high-quality experiences across all customer touchpoints
- **Foster continuous learning:** Provide data-driven insights for skill development
- **Support career growth:** Track progress and identify advancement opportunities

### Building Trust and Transparency

- Scorecards are development tools, not punishment mechanisms
- The focus is on growth, learning, and customer success
- Feedback is collaborative and solution-oriented
- Individual performance data is confidential and used constructively
- The goal is to help each SA reach their full potential

## Reviewing Individual Team Member Calls

### Step-by-Step Review Process

#### 1. Pre-Review Preparation

- Access the Gong platform and navigate to the Scorecards section
- Review the specific scorecard criteria relevant to SA roles
- Identify calls that need review based on your review schedule or priority

#### 2. Initial AI Score Assessment

- Navigate to a specific call from Gong's Home page or Conversations section
- Open the right-side panel and select "Scoring"
- Select the scorecard and GitLab person to apply the scorecard. Gong will provide an initial AI analysis for each question
- Review the AI-generated scores for each criterion
- Note any areas where the AI flagged potential issues or highlights
- Check the confidence level of AI scoring for each category
- If the scorecard question is not relevant to the call, mark the question as N/A

#### 3. Call Listening and Analysis

Listen to key portions of the call, focusing on:

- Technical accuracy and depth of solutions presented
- Customer engagement and rapport building
- Problem-solving approach and methodology
- Communication clarity and effectiveness
- Discovery questioning techniques
- Objection handling and response quality

#### 4. Score Validation and Adjustment

- Compare your assessment with the AI-generated scores
- Make adjustments where human judgment differs from AI analysis
- Add specific comments explaining your reasoning for any score changes
- Document specific examples and timestamps for coaching discussions

#### 5. Coaching Notes Development

- Identify 2-3 key strengths to reinforce
- Highlight 1-2 specific areas for improvement
- Prepare actionable recommendations and resources
- Note any patterns across multiple calls

### Best Practices for Individual Reviews

- **Focus on behaviors, not outcomes:** Evaluate what the SA did well or could improve, rather than just whether they won the deal
- **Be specific and actionable:** Provide concrete examples and clear next steps
- **Balance positive and constructive feedback:** Acknowledge strengths while addressing development areas
- **Consider context:** Factor in customer complexity, deal stage, and unique circumstances
- **Document thoroughly:** Keep detailed notes for follow-up coaching sessions

## Using Gong Insights for Team Performance

## Solutions Architecture Rules of Engagement (FY27)

### Overview

To maximize Solutions Architecture leverage and ensure high-impact customer engagement, the following Rules of Engagement (ROE) define when and how SAs should be engaged during the sales cycle.

### Core Engagement Principles

#### Stage Requirements

**SAs should not be engaged prior to Stage 2-Scoping**

Solutions Architects focus on qualified opportunities where business discovery has been completed (e.g., MEDDPICC has been captured) and the customer is ready to work with an SA to scope a potential solution for evaluation. Early-stage discovery and qualification activities should be handled by the sales team before SA engagement.

#### Opportunity Qualification

**High-Quality MEDDPPICC Required**

All Salesforce opportunities must have at a minimum, high-quality MEDDPPICC qualification before requesting SA engagement.

- **Metrics**: Clear success criteria and measurable business outcomes. These are in the context of the customer.
- **Economic Buyer**: Identified and accessible
- **Decision Criteria**: Business evaluation criteria documented. This will be updated with solution and technical criteria during stage-2.
- **Decision Process**: Timeline, stakeholders, and approval process understood
- **Paper Process**: Contract/procurement requirements identified
- **Identify Pain**: Customer's true pain points clearly articulated based on discovery.
- **Champion**: Active internal champion identified and engaged
- **Competition**: Competitive landscape understood

The MEDDPPICC qualification must reflect the customer's **true pains and goals**, not superficial requirements.

#### Customer Success Plan (CSP) Requirement

**Stage 2-Scoping:**

- SA engagement should have the ability to create a [Customer Success Plan](/handbook/solutions-architects/processes#customer-success-plan). This is only possible when there is the opportunity to do deeper technical discovery, map technical capabilities to the customer's desired outcome, and define holistic solutions (e.g., software, use-cases, services required, expected time to value)
- The CSP documents business outcomes, strategic requirements, and technical evaluation criteria in collaboration with the customer
- CSP creation indicates a consultative, strategic engagement

**Stage 3-Technical Evaluation:**

- If a CSP cannot be created in Stage 2-Scoping, the SA will engage using a **lower-touch, high-velocity model** in Stage 3
- High-velocity engagements focus on efficient technical validation activities with fewer overall touchpoints (custom demos, workshop, specific technical questions) rather than strategic planning and higher touch POV related work.
- The SA maintains discretion on engagement level based on opportunity complexity and strategic value

#### Active Opportunity Requirement

**SAs cannot engage in accounts where there is not a First Order or Growth opportunity forecasted in Salesforce within the next 3 quarters (maximum)**

This ensures SA resources are focused on near-term revenue-generating activities. Accounts without active opportunities should be directed to:

- Customer Success (for existing customers)
- Support channels (for technical questions)

### Exceptions Process

**The SA team will remain flexible and accommodate exceptions to these ROEs**

Exceptions should be coordinated through the following process:

1. Account Executive or SA identifies a valid reason for an exception (e.g., strategic account, unusual circumstance, executive request)
2. Request exception approval from the **SA Manager** before engaging
3. SA Manager reviews and approves/denies based on business justification
4. **SA Manager tracks all exceptions** for analysis and ROE iteration

Exception tracking enables the organization to:

- Identify patterns that may require ROE adjustments
- Ensure consistent application of guidelines
- Maintain visibility into SA resource allocation

### Field Marketing Collaboration

**[Placeholder: Field Marketing Planning Process]**

*Process to be defined for SA engagement in field marketing events, including:*

- *Event qualification criteria*
- *Lead time requirements for SA participation*
- *Planning collaboration workflow between SA and Field Marketing teams*
- *Post-event follow-up and opportunity handoff process*

### SA Request Process

When requesting SA engagement:

- Ensure the opportunity meets all ROE requirements above or an exception has been granted

### Benefits of These ROEs

These Rules of Engagement enable:

- **Increased SA Leverage**: SAs focus on high-quality, high-probability opportunities
- **Better Customer Outcomes**: Customers receive strategic guidance for higher quality engagement, leading to better opportunity outcomes
- **Improved Win Rates**: SAs engage when they can provide maximum value
- **Efficient Resource Allocation**: SA time invested where it drives revenue
- **Consistent Experience**: Clear expectations for sales teams and customers

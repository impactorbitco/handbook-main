## Career Development

Solutions Architecture team members you should review the [GitLab People Group Career Development page](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/career-development/) for the roles, responsibilities, and helpful career development resources.

### Solution Architecture Specific Career Development

#### Career Paths

Because of the valuable experience and skills gained while driving customer outcomes, Solutions Architects can move to a variety of technical, sales and leadership roles in GitLab and across industries.
The diagram below can help you exploring potential evolutions of your career development.

While maturing a decision or assessing options, the below steps can help you throughout the process:

1. Have a [career development conversation](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/career-development/#what-is-career-development) with your manager to discuss the learning opportunity. It's important to:

    - Discuss the Career Path you want to explore and your motivation
    - Learn about what involves to be in these roles (for instance, you can read the job description for the roles you are interested in or speak directly with people who are in these roles)
    - Draft an [Individual Growth Plan](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/career-development/#individual-growth-plan) where you highlight:

         - Options you are looking to explore
         - Gaps you might see with where you are now in your development compared you want to be
         - Timing
         - Explore existing and future job openings in GitLab

2. If the career move you are looking to do is in GitLab but outside of your current team, discuss with your manager to speak to the DRI for the job opening you are looking to potentially apply for
3. Before speaking to the DRI, draft a clear set of questions you want to ask, based on job description and any doubts/questions you have from chatting with others already in the role
4. Schedule a coffee chat or start a slack DM with the DRI of the job opening
5. Discuss with your manager the outcome of these conversations and your decision
6. If you are ready to apply, go ahead and apply for the role. Good Luck with your application!

#### Promotion Process

The Solutions Architecture promotion process augments the [People Group Promotion Process](/handbook/people-group/promotions-transfers/) with the following:

1. The Planning stage of the calibration process [here](/handbook/people-group/promotions-transfers/#twice-per-year-promotion-calibration-process--timeline) typically means the SA leaders have forecasted the promotion candidates at least 2 quarters ahead of the promotion cycle.

##### Staff and Principal Promotion Processes

1. For Staff and Principal level promotions, the promotion justification document must be completed 2 quarters prior to promotion date and submitted to the VP of SA for review.
1. For Staff and Principal level promotions, the promotion candidate's manager will consult with the SA leadership team, typically during a weekly team meeting. This is to ensure continuous calibration for Staff and above-level roles that have lower representation amongst the SA organization.  This must occur 2 quarters before the expected promotion quarter.  For example, for a Q4 promotion, the calibration should occur in Q2.
1. In consideration of promotion and budget contraints, Staff and Principal level promotions will be limited to a predetermined number of candidates per quarter.

##### Staff Reccomendations and Presentation

1. For Staff level promotions, the promotion candidate's manager will consult with existing Staff and Principal level SAs for peer-level review and feedback while taking detailed notes to be reviewed with SA leadership ([Staff Solution Architect Promotion Review Questionaire](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yrHfXPOEtpdBiakaPLjtx09kApda47ezpa9TZFr4K2w/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.do0pa3gyqsd9)).
1. In addition to the standard promotion document, Staff candidates have the option to prepare a presentation of their accomplishments and alignment to the expectations of a Staff level SA, and their vision for driving future impact.  They also can optionally present to the panel of stakeholders, SA leaders, and current Staff/Principal SAs.

##### Principal Reccomendations and Presentation

1. For Principal level promtions, the Principal candidate will collect letters of recommendations from GitLab and external stakeholders.
1. For Principal level promotions, the Principal candidates will prepare and present their accomplishments and their vision for improving GitLab and the SA organization to a panel of SA leaders, Staff/Principal level SAs, and other GitLab stakeholders after the review with SA leadership (2 quarters prior to the promotion cycle).  This happens before the standard promotion cycle calibrations. The candidates will be assessed based on their professionalism, alignment to GitLab values, the [SA mission](/handbook/solutions-architects/), the expectations of Staff/Principal SA, and their vision for driving future impact.
1. The Principal promotion panel will then meet to discuss the candidate's suitability for the Principal SA role.

### Associate Solution Architecture Program

In FY23, GitLab launched its inaugural Associate SA program, now an annual initiative designed to achieve multiple goals, including:

- Build the next generation of highly-diverse, well-prepared GitLab Solutions Architects
- Grow pre-sales engineering skill sets that are focused on GitLab's product offering, business model and aligned to customer needs
- Give existing SAs an opportunity to grow in their careers through having early-in-career SAs to mentor and coach

The program leverages the enablement material that all SAs use in the onboarding process in addition
to providing team members earlier in their careers content that instills a passion for a single DevOps Platform built on open source.

The program helps build technical, trusted advisory muscle memory, places team members in a role serving the SMB segment, and in a function where there is
high awareness of priorities that are aligned to visible results.

**If you are looking to be considered for the Associate SA Program**, look at our Job Board for any Associate SA postings.

## Recognition

Recognizing the hard work that the Solutions Architects bring to the sales process and to GitLab itself is something we hold dear.  The SA organization should feel proud of the wins they achieve.  Whether they are business related or personal goals reached, SA's deserve to be called out for their accomplishments.

### Peer Recognition

Recognizing (and being recognized) by your peers is extremely fulfilling.  If an SA is recognized by a peer, it may appear in one or more of these places:

- The #thanks Slack Channel (Used by the entire company for all manner of appreciation.)
- The #team-member-updates Slack Channel (Used by the entire company for promotion recognition.)
- The #win-wire Slack Channel (Used primarily by the Field Organization for recognizing work on sales deals.)
- The #wins-key-deals Slack Channel (When an SA is associated with a high profile win, they are automatically added to the details of the win within this channel. SA Leadership is working with Sales Ops to bring more attention to this notification.)
- Various team meetings (At the start of most SA calls, there is a devoted section for expressing gratitude and appreciation.)
- [Discretionary Bonuses](/handbook/total-rewards/incentives/#discretionary-bonuses-for-individuals) (If an SA has gone above and beyond and truly lived up to GitLab's CREDIT values, a discretionary bonus of $1000 US can be awarded. These nominations can come from anyone in the company and at any time.)

### Management Recognition

At various points of the year, SA's have the opportunity to be recognized by their managers and/or SA leadership.

- [Field Organization Quarterly Achievers](/handbook/sales/field-operations/field-enablement/field-team-recognition/) (12 various winners from accross the Field Organization for outstanding performance in the Quarter. A designated chat with the CEO, CRO and the other winners as well as a $250 US expensed dinner are included)
- [President's Club](https://internal.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/presidents-club/) (13 members of the SA organization (and their optional guests) from across the globe are selected based on contributions throughout the year. More on the selection criteria can be found in the internal link)

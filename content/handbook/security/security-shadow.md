title: Security Shadow Program
---

The Security Division Shadow Program offers Individual Contributor (IC) team members the opportunity to shadow a security department of their choice. This program is designed to provide hands-on experience with the different functional areas of security, foster cross-team collaboration, and develop a deeper understanding of our security division.

The Security Shadow program is designed to provide numerous benefits including:

- Broader security expertise
- Enhanced cross-departmental collaboration
- Build stronger working relationships with participants

During the shadow period, the participant will:

- Work directly with a dedicated mentor from their chosen department
- Participate in hands-on activities
- Learn about different security domains and how they interconnect
- Build relationships with security team members across the division
- Attend function-specific meetings and activities

## How the Security Shadow Program works

Each security department may host 1 individual at a time. Availability of each team is determined by the department leader. Once a department has confirmed ability to host a participant, the department will create a Shadow agenda and a Shadow application will be made available on LevelUp. Interested participants will select one security department to shadow. Applicants will be matched to their selected team on a first applied, first matched basis.

## Shadow Program Time Commitment and Structure

The time commitment for the Shadow program is 4-6 weeks for 2-4 hours per week. The Shadow mentor will be responsible for:

- Developing a shadow agenda
- Determining specific topics to be covered during the shadow experience
- Selecting appropriate activities and meetings for the participant to participate in
- Providing guidance and answering questions throughout the program

While each participating department will have a customized agenda, all participants will:

- Program Support: Spend dedicated time to shadowing one key program/project in the host department
- Team Engagement: Attend weekly team sync meetings with host function
- 1:1 Connections: Attend weekly check-ins with assigned mentor
- Function Immersion: Participate in at least one critical function-specific meeting (planning, review, etc.)
- Shadowing Sessions: Complete 2-3 dedicated shadowing sessions observing key responsibilities

## Program Eligibility

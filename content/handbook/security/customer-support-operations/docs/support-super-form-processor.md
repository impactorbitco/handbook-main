This is an information page for the Support Super form.

If you are looking for information about managing it, please see [workflows](/handbook/security/customer-support-operations/workflows).

While there are many functions here, most are involving creating artifacts for other teams to work (such as issues or tickets). This page will focus on the ones that directly (or indirectly) involve Customer Support Operations.

### Disable US Government Support exception for an Account

This is for disabling US Government Support on a SFDC account that currently has an exception on it.

It will create a request issue.

### Create a Zendesk macro

This will handle macro creation, either via automation or via a request issue. For "simple" macros, it fully creates the macro automatically. For "complex" ones, it will create a request issue.

### Create a support ticket on behalf of a prospect or customer

This will handle creating a ticket as an end-user.

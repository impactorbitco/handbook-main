## What are Zendesk deletion schedules?

As per [Zendesk](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/8301879320474-Managing-deletion-schedules):

> Deletion schedules help you manage data retention by automatically removing data to comply with privacy laws. You can create schedules for end-user data, tickets, attachments, bot-only conversations, and custom object records. Activate, edit, clone, deactivate, or delete these schedules as needed to maintain control over your data storage and ensure compliance with data retention regulations.

## Implementation Manual Procedure

### Leadership

GitLab is committed to information security. The general objective for the ISMS is to protect GitLab's confidential information and assets against new and existing security and privacy risks while maintaining confidentiality, integrity and availability. Objectives for individual security controls are inherited by the in scope security standards and regulations which are: ISO 27001:2022, ISO 42001:2023 and SOC 2 Type 2.

The council, comprised of Security and Privacy (Legal) leadership, shall meet on a minimum of an annual basis to discuss the state of the management system and measure the fulfillment of all management system objectives. The following topics will be covered:

- Review of membership and objectives
- ISMS & AIMS Internal Audit Results
- Significant controlled document updates
- Results of the Annual Security Risk Assessment
- Changes to Risk Heatmap (trends)
- Output from Continuous Control Monitoring
- Observations (CA/PAs)
- Changes that could affect the management system
- Feedback and improvements
- Management system inputs and outputs

### Planning

GitLab has implemented a formal [Security Operational Risk Management ("StORM") program](/handbook/security/security-assurance/security-risk/storm-program/) to identify, rank, track, and treat cybersecurity, IT, and privacy operational risks in support of GitLab's organization-wide objectives. Internal and external issues that could impact GitLab's ability to achieve the intended outcomes of the ISMS and AIMS are identified as part of the StORM or [Observation Management Program](/handbook/security/security-assurance/observation-management-procedure.md). The process for selecting in scope information security controls is executed by the Security Compliance team, leveraging technical functionality from the third party GRC application, and overseen by the Security Risk team. Implementation status is captured in GitLab's GRC application as well as in the Statement of Applicability.

On an annual basis, the CEO will establish company objectives for the year that cascade down to all divisions, including Security and AI teams. These objectives ensure that security and AI management priorities remain aligned with GitLab's overall strategic direction, providing a framework for defining specific actions to support the intended outcomes of both the ISMS and AIMS.

### Support

GitLab has implemented a formal security awareness training program that includes: new hire security awareness training, global annual security awareness training and quarterly targeted phishing exercises. These trainings are administered through a third party portal and include a quiz to test understanding of the security topics presented.

A formal [controlled document procedure](/handbook/security/controlled-document-procedure/) is in place to ensure that there is consistency in developing and maintaining controlled documents at GitLab utilizing a hierarchal approach. All controlled documents are available to all GitLab team members and the public through the [GitLab handbook](/) unless otherwise noted. Updates to controlled documents are managed via [GitLab merge requests](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/) which are also accessible to all GitLab team members for the entire workflow. An annual review of controlled documents is required by the owner or assigned representative.

GitLab publishes [Job Families](/handbook/hiring/job-families/) to define roles and responsibilities based on level for all team members. This information is publicly available and the foundation for team member hiring and performance reviews. On a minimum of an annual basis, GitLab management executes [talent assessments](/handbook/people-group/talent-assessment/) with team members to ensure competency to Job Family.

### Communication

In accordance with ISO 27001:2022 Clause 7.4 and ISO 42001:2023 Clause 7.4, GitLab has established comprehensive communication procedures for both the ISMS and AIMS:

**ISMS Communications:**

- **What will be communicated:** Security policies, procedures, incidents, risk assessments, control effectiveness, compliance status, and security awareness materials
- **When to communicate:** During onboarding, quarterly updates, incident response, annual reviews, and as policies are updated
- **With whom to communicate:** All team members, leadership, customers (as appropriate), and external stakeholders including auditors and regulators
- **How to communicate:** Through the GitLab handbook, Slack channels, email notifications, training portals, quarterly all-hands meetings, and formal reporting mechanisms

**AIMS Communications:**

- **What will be communicated:** AI governance policies, AI risk assessments, AI system performance metrics, ethical AI guidelines, AI incident reports, and AI compliance status
- **When to communicate:** During AI system deployment, monthly AI governance reviews, incident response, quarterly business reviews, and annual AIMS assessments
- **With whom to communicate:** AI development teams, product management, legal and compliance teams, executive leadership, customers using AI features, and relevant regulatory bodies
- **How to communicate:** Through dedicated AI governance channels, product documentation, customer communications, executive dashboards, and formal AI governance reporting

### Operations

The [GitLab team handbook](/) is the central repository for how we run the company. Everything at GitLab is handbook first, to include development of company policies, standards and procedures. Key controlled documents that support the management system include:

- [Data Classification Standard](/handbook/security/policies_and_standards/data-classification-standard/)
- [Internal Acceptable Use Policy](/handbook/people-group/acceptable-use-policy/)
- [Security Policies](/handbook/security/security-and-technology-policies/security-and-technology-policies-management/)
- [GitLab Code of Business Conduct and Ethics](https://ir.gitlab.com/governance/governance-documents/default.aspx)
- [Infrastructure Change Management Procedure](/handbook/engineering/infrastructure-platforms/change-management/)
- [Security Operational Risk Management (StORM) Program & Procedures](/handbook/security/security-assurance/security-risk/storm-program/)
- [GitLab AI Ethics Principles for Product Development](/handbook/legal/ethics-compliance-program/ai-ethics-principles.md)
- [General Purpose AI Tool Usage Guidelines](https://internal.gitlab.com/handbook/legal-and-corporate-affairs/ai-tool-usage-guidelines/)
- [Approved AI Tools](https://internal.gitlab.com/handbook/company/ai-at-gitlab/#approved-ai-tools)

GitLab has a dedicated Security Compliance team responsible for monitoring design and effectiveness of the [GitLab common control framework](/handbook/security/security-assurance/security-compliance/sec-controls/) to ensure GitLab's security objectives are thoughtfully planned, implemented and monitored.

If using a third-party service to outsource or supplement security processes, a [third party risk assessment](/handbook/security/security-assurance/security-risk/third-party-risk-management/) is executed prior to onboarding. Critical vendors are also reviewed once per calendar year after onboarding, or at contract renewal if it comes first.

### Performance

GitLab monitors, measures, and improves security controls and AI systems through various continuous monitoring measures:

**ISMS Monitoring and Measurement:**

- [Continuous control testing/Annual management system internal compliance audits](/handbook/security/security-assurance/security-compliance/security-control-lifecycle/)
- [External audits (SOC 2 Type 2, TISAX, customer security assessments)](security-assurance/security-compliance/certifications/)
- [Annual security operational risk assessments](/handbook/security/security-assurance/security-risk/storm-program/)
- [Annual third-party penetration testing](/handbook/security/security-and-technology-policies/penetration-testing-policy/)
- [Ongoing third party scorecard monitoring (BitSight)](/handbook/security/security-assurance/field-security/independent_security_assurance/#third-party-security-ratings)
- [Infrastructure Vulnerability scanning](product-security/vulnerability-management/)
- [Application Vulnerability Scanning](product-security/application-security/vulnerability-management/)

### Improvement

GitLab is committed to continually improving the suitability, adequacy and effectiveness of the management system in accordance with both ISO 27001:2022 and ISO 42001:2023 requirements.

As part of GitLab's tier 2 security operational risk program, each risk identified and triaged through the StORM program is required to undergo a [risk response decision](/handbook/security/security-assurance/security-risk/storm-program/#risk-response). This is an activity that will be discussed with each individual risk owner for the risks that they own. Additionally, GitLab identifies and monitors tier 3 risks, also referred to as observations, as per the [Observation Management Procedure](/handbook/security/security-assurance/observation-management-procedure/).

## Exceptions

Exceptions to Information Security policies or procedures will be tracked as per the [Information Security Policy Exception Management Process](/handbook/security/controlled-document-procedure/#exceptions).

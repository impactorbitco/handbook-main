## Security Review Framework

> [!WARNING]
> This process is currently being tested by the AppSec team and is subject to change. For security review requests, please use the [AppSec review process](./application-security/appsec-reviews/).

This security review framework empowers GitLab Product teams with a streamlined approach to security evaluations, making it easier to engage with
the right security partners based on your feature's needs, risk profile, and
[Go-to-market tier](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/gitlab-rd-planning/-/wikis/R&D-Interlock-Process#labels-guide).
Designed to maintain your development velocity while ensuring appropriate security coverage, the framework begins with a simple
team routing process that connects you directly with the most relevant security experts—whether that's [Secure Design and Development](./application-security/appsec-operations/sdd-services/) or
[Infrastructure Security](./infrastructure-security/) with additional specialized support from [Security Platforms and Architecture (SPA)](./security-platforms-architecture/) and [Data Security teams](./data-security/) for features
with High or Critical risk scores. This focused approach ensures you receive timely, targeted security guidance without unnecessary process overhead.

The security review framework is designed to work in tandem with the [Product Development Flow](/handbook/product-development/how-we-work/product-development-flow/).
The ideal trigger point for a security review of a feature is during the Design phase
([Validation phase 3: Design](/handbook/product-development/how-we-work/product-development-flow/#validation-phase-3-design) indicated in
issue by `workflow::design` label).
The [key-participants](/handbook/product-development/how-we-work/roles-and-responsibilities/) involved in Design phase are encouraged
to engage with the security review framework to determine whether the feature requires a security review.

### Scope of SRF

1. End to End Security review of a feature
2. Design reviews

#### Example use-cases

1. As a Product Designer, you want to make sure the design of the new feature has taken into consideration all the security best practices.
2. As a Developer creating a potential design for implementing the new feature, you like to confirm whether it will lead to loss of
confidentiality and integrity of the customer data or have a negative impact on the availability of GitLab instance.
3. As an Engineering manager reviewing the new design of a feature, you suspect a design choice might result in a security issue and would like to
verify it with the security team.
4. As an Product Manager, working on the a
[GTM Tier-0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Pis-VRUYTlitNjoKmDKNQMIf-4bWBo5XjPyWOYo0R54/edit?gid=838006198#gid=838006198&range=B20) feature,
you want to make sure the feature does not introduce any security risks to customers.

#### Following type of requests are out of scope of SRF

1. Ad-hoc MR review requests (unless the feature is already reviewed by SRF)
2. General application security questions

How the security review framework fits into a product teams' workflows is visualized in the following
section.

### Framework purpose

1. Identify which GitLab features needs a security review from the Product Security teams.
1. Which type of [security review](#3-review-process-by-team-and-risk-level) is needed, from the Product Security teams.
1. Which Product Security team(s) needs to be engaged for the security review.
1. Which deliverables Product and Engineering can expect from the various reviews types of security reviews.

### Team Responsibilities

| Team | Focus Areas | Engagement Criteria |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| [Secure Design and Development](/handbook/security/product-security/application-security/appsec-operations/sdd-services/) | Code vulnerabilities, threat modeling, developer education, authentication, authorization, input validation | Sensitive data handling, auth changes, new technologies, third-party integrations, customer-facing features |
| [Infrastructure Security](/handbook/security/product-security/infrastructure-security/) | Infrastructure configurations, network security, deployment, cloud security, container orchestration, infrastructure-as-code | New infrastructure, deployment changes, network modifications, cloud provider configuration, container security |
| [Data Security](/handbook/security/product-security/data-security/) | Data access controls, data infrastructure, data lifecycle, cryptography, key management, third-party services | Engage on any high-risk or complex change involving our focus areas. If unsure, tag us or reach out and ask in #security-datasec |
| [SPA](/handbook/security/product-security/security-platforms-architecture/) | System design, data flows, architectural patterns, trust boundaries, component interactions | Escalated reviews from InfraSec and SD&D Team in case of: <br> - Major architectural changes that systematically impact how we develop, build, deploy or run our product (e.g., Dedicated, Cells, Runway)<br>- Significant modifications to Authentication/Authorization at application or infrastructure level<br>- Changes to build/distribution practices that substantially impact the software supply chain<br>- Architectural changes for features that are fundamental to annual business goals |

## 1: Security Team Routing

The first step is to determine which security team(s) should be engaged for the security review of the feature. This routing happens before the
detailed risk assessment to ensure teams only answer questions relevant to their domain.

### Initial Triage Questions

When a product team initiates a [feature](#security-review-phase-1-initial-triage), they complete an initial triage to determine team routing:

#### Secure Design and Development Triggers

* Does this feature handle customer repositories, credentials, PII data? (Y/N)
* Does this feature add or modify any core mechanisms related to authentication, authorization or cryptography? (Y/N)
* Does this feature interact with third-party services? (Y/N)
* Does this feature add a [new service component](https://docs.gitlab.com/development/adding_service_component/)? (Y/N)
* Does this change have an indirect impact on core mechanisms related to authentication, authorization or cryptography ? (Y/N)

#### Infrastructure Security Triggers

* Does this feature require new cloud infrastructure components? (Y/N)
* Does this feature modify containerization or orchestration configurations? (Y/N)
* Does this feature change network architecture or security groups? (Y/N)
* Does this feature alter infrastructure-as-code implementations? (Y/N)
* Does this feature modify production deployment processes? (Y/N)
* Does this feature introduce any new data stores (e.g. cloud storage bucket, database, cache)? (Y/N)
* Does this feature modify secrets management or credential handling ? (Y/N)

### Team Routing Logic

Based on the responses to these triage questions, the system routes the review to the appropriate team(s):

```text
IF ANY Secure Design and Development Trigger is YES
    THEN engage Secure Design and Development Team
IF ANY Infrastructure Security Trigger is YES
    THEN engage Infrastructure Security Team
```

Multiple teams may be engaged for complex features that have triggers across multiple domains.

## 2: Team-Specific Risk Assessment Models

After identifying which team(s) need to be engaged, each engaged team conducts their domain-specific risk assessment to determine review depth.

### Secure Design and Development Risk Dimensions

### Risk Score Calculation

Each engaged team calculates their risk score using their domain-specific dimensions:

```text
Secure Design and Development Risk Score = Data Processing Impact + Feature Exposure + Architecture Impact + Implementation Complexity + Launch Tier Impact
Infrastructure Security Risk Score = Infrastructure Scope + Environment Criticality + Configuration Complexity + Automation Level + Launch Tier Impact
```

### Risk Categorization

Each team categorizes risk based on their domain-specific score:

#### Secure Design and Development

* Score ≥ 15: Critical Risk
* Score 12-14: High Risk
* Score 8-11: Medium Risk
* Score < 8: Low Risk

Security review process for each risk level is detailed in [Secure Design and Development Review Process](#secure-design-and-development-review-process) section.

#### Infrastructure Security

* Score ≥ 15: Critical Risk
* Score 12-14: High Risk
* Score 8-11: Medium Risk
* Score < 8: Low Risk

Security review process for each risk level is detailed in [Infrastructure Security Review Process](#infrastructure-security-review-process) section.

### Security Review Priority

Priority of a Security review is determined by taking into account [roadmap priority](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/gitlab-rd-planning/-/wikis/R&D-Interlock-Process/#labels-guide) of the feature (`Interlock Priority::P1`,
`Interlock Priority::P2`, `Interlock Priority::P3`) and the feature [risk score](#risk-categorization)

|#| (Risk score) <br>Critical | High | Medium | Low |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |--|--|
| (Roadmap priority) <br> P1     |  Review-Priority:1      |    Review-Priority:2    |Review-Priority:3 | Self-Service|
|    P2   |  Review-Priority:2      |   Review-Priority:3     |Review-Priority:4 | Self-Service|
|     P3   |  Review-Priority:3      |  Review-Priority:4      | Review-Priority:4|Self-Service |

### SPA and Data Security team engagement criteria

#### For Secure Design and Development Review

The feature is flagged for a Architecture review and/or Data Security review if there is a major Architecture Impact or Data Processing Impact identified during the Risk score calculation.

```text
IF Architecture Impact >= 4
    THEN Flag the feature for Architecture review by SPA team
IF Data Processing Impact >= 4 then
    THEN Flag the feature for Data Security review by Data Security team.
```

#### For InfraSec Review

```text
IF Infrastructure Scope >= 4
   THEN Flag the feature for SPA review
IF Environment Criticality>=4
   THEN Flag the feature for Data Security review
```

When feature are flagged for SPA or Data Security review it will be indicated by a label that is added to the review request.

### Review SLO

These are initial estimates and are subjected to change as we adopt the framework.

Note: _Low risk level is not mentioned here since Product team is the DRI for those reviews._

|Review Type | Critical Risk Level| High Risk Level|Medium Risk level|
|--|--|--|--|
|SDX Design Review|10 days|5 days|--|
|SDX Code Review (May extend based on number of MRs)|10 days|5 days |--|
|SDX Verify|10 days|5 days|--|
|Security checklist completion |--|--|5 days|

#### How early the review needs to be submitted ?

Review requests received at least 10 calendar days before the next milestone starts will be scoped for next milestone.

Requests received later than 10 days before the next milestone starts will be scoped for milestone+2.

The SLO will start from the date on which the planned milestone starts.

### Infrastructure Security Review Process

Note: _The list of reviews mentioned in this section are examples and not comprehensive nor do they always apply._

* InfraSec Reviews DRI: InfraSec Team

### Exception workflow

The Security Review Framework (SRF) is in a dry-run phase and has not been rolled out yet, so the exception workflow is currently not applicable. After the SRF is rolled out and before security reviews become mandatory for feature releases, an appropriate [exception workflow](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/product-security/appsec/appsec-team/-/issues/1294) will be added to the SRF to cover situations such as releasing features without completing the necessary security reviews.

## 4. Implementation

### Security Review Phase 1: Initial Triage

1. The security review process begins with a product team requesting a security review for a feature. The ideal time for requesting a review would be during the [design phase](../../product-development/how-we-work/product-development-flow/#validation-phase-3-design), when the design is ready (For any AppSec or InfraSec questions before design phase, please follow [Contacting us](./application-security/#contacting-us) and [Working With Us](./infrastructure-security/#working-with-us) respectively). This is done by adding a label
`SecurityReview::Requested` to a feature issue or epic (`~"type::feature"`).
1. ProdSec automation will then add the initial triage questionnaire
to this feature issue, ping the review initiator for completion, and add the label `initial-triage:pending-answers`. The [initial triage questionnaire](#initial-triage-questions)
is a set of Yes/No questions to determine whether this feature needs a review from Secure Design and Development (SD&D, SPA) or InfraSec.
1. Once the phase 1 questionnaire is completed, the review initiator removes the `initial-triage:pending-answers` label.

### Security Review Phase 2: Determine Risk Score

1. The ProdSec automation will then run the Team Routing Logic to decide which teams need to perform the security review of the feature and add their
corresponding Risk Dimensions questionnaire to the feature issue. Review initiator is pinged  for completing the questions and the label
`risk-dimension:pending-answers` is added to the issue as well.
1. When the questionnaire is completed, the review initiator removes the `risk-dimension:pending-answers` label.
1. The ProdSec automation will then calculate the Risk Score, which determines the review type and recommended timeline. A Security Review request issue is then opened by ProdSec
automation in the ProdSec ingestion queue.

The Security Review request issue in the ProdSec ingestion queue will contain the following details and the ProdSec ingestion triage process can
redirect the request to the team members.

1. Initial triage questionnaire and its answers
2. Secure Design and Development Risk Dimensions questionnaire and its answers
3. Infrastructure Security Risk Dimensions and its answers (if applicable)
4. Secure Design and Development risk score
5. Infrastructure Security risk score (if applicable)
6. Recommended Security review type
7. Recommended Security review teams (SD&D, SPA, InfraSec)

### Security Review Phase 3: Conduct Security Review

Based on the risk score the ProdSec conducts Critical, High or Medium level Security review.

## Rotate Service Account Personal Access Tokens (PATs) Runbook

This runbook is an approach to rotating a GitLab Service Accounts Personal Access Tokens (PATs). From here on out we will refer to Personal Access Tokens as PATS and singular use of Personal Access Token as PAT.

### 1. Why is this important?

- Services Accounts can have their PATs expire and therefore preventing resources from being accessed. This blocks API access, Pipeline completion, and individual jobs from running properly and completing their work.
- This runbook is meant to be a structured way to help someone new to this problem, or as a reminder to those who have engaged this problem before but forgot specifics, to attempt to solve the issue with PAT rotations for the Service Accounts.

### 2. Pre-requisites?

- Find the affected Service Account, hopefully you or someone in the team will receive an email like the one in the screenshot below:

![GitLab Security Service - Architecture - Inventory PAT Email](/images/security/product-security/security-platforms-and-architecture/security-service-architecture-inventory.png)

- If not already completed, create an issue like [GitLab Security Service - Architecture - Inventory's PAT expired](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/product-security/product-security-engineering/product-security-engineering-team/-/issues/262).
- Check and see if you have access to the Service Accounts login credentials in 1Password like below:

![Service Account in 1Password](/images/security/product-security/security-platforms-and-architecture/service-account-1password.png)

- If you do not have access, submit an Access Request (AR) like this [issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/team-member-epics/access-requests/-/issues/36630).

### 3. Steps to fix

- Make sure you are logged out of your personal account on GitLab.com.
- Using the Service Accounts credentials in 1Password, login in to GitLab.com with them.
- Use the `one-time password` parameter in 1Password for the MFA OTP.
- You should land on the Service Account's Project page like below:

![Service Account Landing Page](/images/security/product-security/security-platforms-and-architecture/service-account-landing-page.png)

- Select the Service Account's icon and click on `Edit Profile` like below:

![Service Account Edit Profile](/images/security/product-security/security-platforms-and-architecture/service-account-edit-profile.png)

- Click on `Access tokens` in the `User settings` then click the `Add new token` button:

![Service Account Access Token Page](/images/security/product-security/security-platforms-and-architecture/service-account-access-token-page.png)

- Add the `Token name` that matches the previous token that had expired, in this case it is `GitLab Security Service - Architecture - Inventory`.
- Add a `Description` of what the token is used for.
- For `Expiration Date` set it for 365 days in the future (the maximum expiration). If you do not set it, it is default to expire in 30 days.
- Click the `Select scopes` permission level that best matches what access the Service account needs (In this case it is API only), like in the image below:

![Service Account Personal Access Token](/images/security/product-security/security-platforms-and-architecture/service-account-personal-access-token.png)

- Before you click `Create Token` make sure to scroll down the page and `Revoke` the old token, as shown in the image below:

![Service Account Revoke Old Personal Access Token](/images/security/product-security/security-platforms-and-architecture/service-account-revoke-old-personal-access-token.png)

- Then click the `Create token` button and review the confirmation that the new token is in the PAT list on `Personal access tokens` page.

### 4. Steps to test

- Logout of the Service Account and back in to an Account that has permissions to re-run any pipelines associated with the Service Accounts PAT.
- For this particular Service Account, the GitLab Inventory Builder uses this Service Accounts PAT to access APIs.
- So re-running a pipeline job for that repository that was previously failing due to token errors, demonstrated that the PAT rotation was successful as seen in the image below:

![GitLab Inventory Builder Weekly - Monday mornings Pipeline Build](/images/security/product-security/security-platforms-and-architecture/gitlab-inventory-builder-weekly-monday-mornings-pipeline-success.png)

- If the pipeline passes, congratulations, update the issue with the success and notify any concerned parties of the successful PAT rotation, and finally, close the associated issue.

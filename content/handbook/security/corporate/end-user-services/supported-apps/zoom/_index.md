Zoom is our primary audio-visual communications software, used for communicating internally and with external partners. In addition to simple video calls, the app also features many additional features such as automatic recording, and shared whiteboards.

## A Note on Privacy and Security

The Zoom app is directly managed by EUS through Jamf. What this means is that we regularly push updates automatically to ensure that the app remains up-to-date in terms of features and security.

We also review any new features for security risks added before we enable them for use within GitLab. As a result, there may be a delay in getting to use the latest features, or we may decide to block them altogether.

When using Zoom, please ensure the following:

- Ensure that your laptop's OS and the Zoom app are up-to-date. You'll receive a desktop notification with instructions whenever an update is available. **Please note that you may not be able to use the app if it is not updated**
- Ensure that you are properly signed into the Zoom app to have full access to unlimited calls and advanced features
- Ensure you've followed the [laptop configuration guidelines](/handbook/security/corporate/end-user-services/laptop-management/laptop-security)
- Update your Zoom profile and aconsider creating a customized [Personal link](/handbook/security/corporate/end-user-services/supported-apps/zoom/zoom-additional-config/#create-a-customized-personal-link)

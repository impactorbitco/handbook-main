## Test Audio and Video in Zoom

Before using Zoom for the first time, it is recommended to [test your audio]( https://support.zoom.com/hc/en/article?id=zm_kb&sysparm_article=KB0062765) as well as [test your video](https://support.zoom.com/hc/en/article?id=zm_kb&sysparm_article=KB0061836).
Zoom even has its own [test](https://zoom.us/test) that you can utilize to ensure everything is set up correctly.

## Customize your Zoom Profile

You can customize various settings in Zoom; including your display name, location, job tile, etc.

1. Open Chrome and go to your [Zoom Profile page](https://gitlab.zoom.us/profile)
1. Click on **Edit** next to the various fields on the page to make sure all the details are correct

## Create a customized Personal link

Personalized links allow you to create shorter and more memorble links for your Zoom meetings.

<div class="w3-panel w3-yellow">
  <h3>Talent Acquisition Team</h3>
  <p>Personalized Links are used to schedule interviews. It is important that the default naming convention (<code>gitlab.firstnamelastname</code>) is used and there is no password set for meetings.</p>
</div>

Your personal link is a great way to provide a consistent, easy-to-read-and-remember meeting room for colleagues and customers.\
 However, there are some drawbacks to reusing the same meeting, such as participants joining an ongoing meeting when two are scheduled back to back. In some cases it may be better to use a unique meeting link.

**Setup**

1. Go to your [profile page](https://gitlab.zoom.us/profile).
1. In the Meeting section, you can see your "Personal Link"
1. Select **Customize** and **Save Change** once you are done
1. Navigate to the [meetings page](https://gitlab.zoom.us/meeting).
1. Select the top tab "Personal Room".
1. Towards the bottom of the page, select "Edit" and uncheck the "Passcode" box.
1. Select "Save".

## Zoom Waiting Rooms

It's recommended you enable the [Waiting Room](https://support.zoom.com/hc/en/article?id=zm_kb&sysparm_article=KB0063329) feature for your personal meeting room to prevent others from joining (in the event of back-to-back meetings, for example).\
There are a few steps to get this enabled for personal meetings:

1. Go to your [Zoom setings page](https://gitlab.zoom.us/profile/setting)
1. Click on the **Meeting** tab
1. Scroll down to **Security** and toggle the **Waiting Room** option on
1. You can now further edit the waiting room options and/or customize your waiting room with custom videos or images.
    1. Please see [Zoom's official documentation](https://support.zoom.com/hc/en/article?id=zm_kb&sysparm_article=KB0059359) for more details

## Enable Screen Sharing

In order to share your screen with call participants, you need to grant Zoom the appropriate access in your Mac's system settings.

<div class="w3-panel w3-yellow">
  <h3>Attention!</h3>
  <p>We recommend to enable this setting ASAP as enabling this setting will require restarting the Zoom app and the EUS team may ask you to share your screen during support sessions.</p>
</div>

1. Open Zoom and start a meeting using **New meeting**
1. Click **Share** and select a screen or application window to share
1. A prompt should appear asking you to allow "zoom.us" to record this computer's screen and audio, click "Open System Settings". Enable "zoom" from the list that appears.
    1. To manually enable this open your Mac System Settings app and navigate to Privacy & Security > Screen & System Audio Recording and enable zoom and follow the prompt.
    1. If Zoom does not appear on the list, click the `+` button and manually select the **zoom.us** application
1. Restart Zoom

## Enable captions and live transcription

If you are the meeting host, consider enabling live transcriptions for accessibility. Live transcription is not enabled by default, and must be enabled manually for each meeting:

1. In the Zoom toolbar, select **CC** (for closed captioning).
1. Select **Enable live transcription**.

If the host is not present, no one can enable live transcription. If you've created a meeting but won't be attending, consider assigning alternative host permissions to someone who will be present, so they can enable live transcription.

## Set up a shortcut for muting in Zoom

Sometimes you need a hot key to mute/unmute, even when Zoom is not the selected window.
Follow these steps to set it up:

1. Navigate to `Zoom > Preferences > Keyboard Shortcuts`
1. Tick the box for `Enable Global Shortcut` to `Mute/Unmute My Audio`
1. You can map it to any keyboard shortcut such as `F1` (Cmd 1)

## Enabling email notifications for hosts when attendees join first

1. Go to your Zoom account [settings](https://gitlab.zoom.us/profile/setting).
1. Click the `Meeting` tab.
1. Under `Email notification`, click the `When attendees join meeting before host` toggle to enable or disable it.

Reclaim.ai is an AI-powered calendar management and productivity tool that helps optimize scheduling and time management. The platform integrates with calendar systems to automatically schedule focus time, manage tasks, and optimize meeting schedules.

## Security and Compliance Requirements

As a GitLab team member using Reclaim.ai, you are responsible for understanding and adhering to the following security controls and compliance requirements:

### Index

- [Data Classification](#data-classification)
- [System of Record Maintenance](#system-of-record-maintenance)
- [Manager Responsibilities](#manager-responsibilities)
- [Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity](#disaster-recovery-and-business-continuity)
- [Security Configuration Changes](#security-configuration-changes)

## Data Classification

**Reclaim.ai can process Orange data**

Ensure your use of Reclaim.ai aligns with GitLab's data classification and handling policies. Do not include confidential customer information or other RED data.

## System of Record Maintenance

**Reclaim.ai can augment your calendar, but you're still responsible!**

- GitLab's primary calendar system (Google Calendar) remains the authoritative source for scheduling information
- Reclaim.ai should be used as a productivity enhancement tool, not as the primary system of record
- Regularly verify that information synchronized between Reclaim.ai and your primary calendar systems is accurate
- Maintain backup copies of critical scheduling and task information outside of Reclaim.ai

## Manager Responsibilities

**If you're a manager: make sure you're involved**

- Managers must ensure their team members understand proper Reclaim.ai usage guidelines
- Monitor and review how team members are using Reclaim.ai to ensure compliance with GitLab policies
- Work with your team members to determine what types of information should and should not be managed through Reclaim.ai with the particular concerns of your business unit in mind
- Regularly review team access and usage patterns

## Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity

Users of Reclaim.ai should:

- Maintain alternative scheduling and productivity workflows that do not depend solely on Reclaim.ai
- Ensure critical meetings and tasks are also tracked in GitLab's primary systems (Google Calendar, GitLab issues, etc.)

## Security Configuration Changes

- IT EUS can approve security and configuration changes: any requests should go through the normal [access request process](/handbook/security/corporate/end-user-services/access-requests/access-requests/)
- IT EUS should coordinate with the Security team before making significant configuration changes that affect data transmission
- Anyone making a change should follow standard workflows for configuration changes for audit purposes

## Security Incident Reporting

### Immediate Actions Required

If you suspect a security incident involving Reclaim.ai:

1. **Immediately** change your Reclaim.ai password and revoke any active sessions
2. **Immediately** notify the GitLab Security team via:
   - Slack: `#security-help` channel
   - Following the [Security Incident Response procedure](/handbook/security/security-operations/sirt/sec-incident-response/)

### Types of Incidents to Report

- Compromised Reclaim.ai user accounts
- Unauthorized access to calendar or task data
- Suspicious activity in your Reclaim.ai account
- Potential data breaches or leaks
- Compromised integration accounts or API keys
- Any unusual system behavior that could indicate a security issue

### Information to Include in Reports

- Date and time of the suspected incident
- Description of what occurred or was observed
- Affected accounts or data
- Steps already taken to contain the incident
- Any evidence or logs available

## Data Accuracy and Completeness

Users of Reclaim.ai should:

- Ensure all calendar entries are accurate and up-to-date
- Verify that sensitive or confidential information is appropriately classified and protected
- Review calendar sharing settings to ensure appropriate access levels
- Regularly audit the information being synchronized between Reclaim.ai and other systems
- Remove or update outdated or incorrect calendar information promptly
- Be mindful of what information is being shared through Reclaim.ai's AI features and recommendations

### Data Classification Guidelines

- **Public**: General meeting titles and times that can be shared openly
- **Internal**: GitLab-specific meetings and projects (default classification)
- **Confidential**: Sensitive business information, personnel matters, or strategic discussions
- **Restricted**: Highly sensitive information that should not be processed by external AI systems

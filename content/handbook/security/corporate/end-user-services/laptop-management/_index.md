title: "GitLab Laptop Management"
---

## Introduction

The EUS team oversees all laptop procurement and management. While certain aspects, such as endpoint management configurations, are supported by the CorpSec team, we generally act as the point of contact for all related issues.

At GitLab, we use centralized laptop management for company issued devices. If you are in possession of a company issued device, the details below apply to you. However, not all endpoint management technologies GitLab deploys will be required for all devices. Some technologies may be specific to the hardware platform or operating system.

## Laptop Specs

GitLab approves and supports the use of [Linux](../onboarding101/linux-onboarding101/) and macOS for team member laptops. To keep GitLab IT Support efficient, Windows is not supported as a laptop OS.

Further information on GitLab authorized operating systems, versions, and exception process is available on the internal [Approved Operating Systems for GitLab Team Member Endpoint Systems](https://internal.gitlab.com/handbook/security/corporate/operating-systems/) page.

Apple hardware is the recommended choice for GitLab team members. Team members may select a Dell Linux laptop if they are familiar with Linux and are capable of self-support.

### Apple Hardware

We order Apple laptops in bulk through our global vendors to ensure on time and consistent delivery experiences for all team members.

**We work through existing inventory before ordering new releases** This means the newest model will not be immediately available when announced. There is no set timeline for when new models will be in stock - it will vary by region depending on the pace of new hires and device refreshes in each area.

**Laptop configurations vary by regional inventory availability.** For example, some regions may have 2024 models in Space Gray while others have 2025 models in Silver.

> **Note**: In most cases, we will prioritize new hire laptop orders over refreshes. Refreshes may be delayed, depending on stock availability.

Our standard laptop offerings include:

* MacBook Pro 14-inch - 24GB Unified memory / 1TB storage **Standard model**
* MacBook Pro 16-inch - 64GB Unified memory / 1TB storage **Performance model**
* MacBook Pro 14-inch - 64GB Unified memory / 1TB storage **Performance model**

Most roles that require higher performance machines are approved for a 14" or 16" MacBook Pro performance model. Please see this [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1409j22VpvOwF7DrVGhvJ4PJmwboG0NjoMu6UKx8YXfE/edit?usp=sharing) (public) to determine which machine you are eligible for.

### Linux Hardware

IT strongly encourages team members to select Macs; please only request a Linux laptop if you are experienced in Linux and capable of self-support.

We have standardized on the [Dell](https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-laptops/scr/laptops/appref=ubuntu-linux-os) laptop for Linux users. Due to supply constraints, specific models available from these lines may vary.

Dell does not currently sell laptops pre-installed with Linux in some countries; team members will need to install Linux themselves in those cases.

>The maximum price of Linux laptops is not to exceed **the price of the equivalent [16" MacBook Pro laptop](#apple-hardware)**.

Our **only approved Linux laptop vendor is Dell**. These laptops generally come pre-loaded with Ubuntu Linux in order to save money on unused Windows licenses.

Dell is GitLab's exclusive Linux vendor for the following reasons:

* Dell has the longest history of shipping laptops with Linux pre-installed among major manufacturers.
* Dell is able to ship laptops to most countries in which GitLab team members live.
* As we move forward with Zero Trust networking solutions, we need to have a stable and unified platform for deployment of software components in the GitLab environment.
    Standardization on a single platform for Linux simplifies this.
* Current Ubuntu LTS is the **only approved Linux distribution**; Ubuntu LTS has a record of stability and quick patching.
* Purchasing laptops from a single vendor opens the possibility of corporate discounts.
* [Dell is a certified Ubuntu vendor](https://certification.ubuntu.com/desktop/models?query=&category=Desktop&category=Laptop&level=&release=18.04+LTS&vendors=Dell) They even have their own Ubuntu OEM release of Ubuntu they maintain, and as a result of their effort, the standard Ubuntu Linux LTS image natively supports Dell hardware and even firmware updates.
* To date, all of Dell's major security issues have not been related to their hardware.

### Windows for Customer Support and Product Development

Windows cannot be used to access GitLab Corporate services (e.g. Slack, G-Suite, GitLab.com); Windows OS can only be used in addition to a GitLab managed device. We understand specific roles will need to use Windows to ensure platform and ecosystem support for GitLab customers and partners who develop for the Microsoft Ecosystem.

The usage of virtualized Windows is highly preferred and should satisfy most support and development need. Complete details about Windows usage is available on the internal [Approved Operating Systems for GitLab Team Member Endpoint Systems](https://internal.gitlab.com/handbook/security/corporate/operating-systems/#windows-for-customer-support-and-product-development) page.

## Laptop Management Policies

In addition to specific hardware requirements, we also employ various policies and software solutions to ensure that all GitLab devices remain secure.

### Endpoint Management

#### Jamf

[Jamf](https://www.jamf.com/) allows us to remotely manage all of our Macs to perform tasks such as pushing updates, encrypting devices, remotely locking and wiping laptops, etc. All new Macs purchased and shipped by GitLab vendors are automatically enrolled in Jamf. It may be necessary to manually enroll a laptop if it was self-procured. GitLab Corporate services should not be accessed from a Mac that is not enrolled in Jamf.

#### Fleet

[Fleet](https://fleetdm.com/) is an Open-Source remote management system that is required to be installed on all Dell devices in order to be able to access GitLab Corporate services. Similar to Jamf, it allows us to remotely manage enrolled laptops to ensure security compliance, and perform tasks such as remotely locking and wiping machines.

### Backblaze

[Backblaze](https://www.backblaze.com/) is a tool that might be deployed to backup data on your company owned device in the event of a security or legal hold/investigation and only following a request of the Legal and People Ops teams, subject to local data, privacy and employment laws.

### Apple IDs

Laptops should be configured with security in mind.

We require the use of an @gitlab.com Apple ID that is separate from any personal Apple IDs you may have. Some of these reasons include:

* Backups, keychains and documents are all considered sensitive information, and should not be stored in personal services.
* 2FA for remote lock, wipe, or account resets are common methods of account compromises, and ensuring the use of GitLab.com email addresses also ensures we are in control of that aspect of multi-factor authentication.
* Keeping a strong separation between work and personal accounts will help prevent the accidental leak of information from one to the other, in either direction.

Defense in depth, in part, means you make a best effort to be secure at each layer. To read through more instructions, please refer to [security best practices](/handbook/security/corporate/end-user-services/laptop-management/laptop-security/) when configuring your new laptop.

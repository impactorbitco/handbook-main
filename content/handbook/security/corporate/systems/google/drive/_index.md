## Sharing Lead Data with External Partners via Google Drive

### Data Classification

Google Drive is approved for **Orange Data** classification.

### Use Case

Use this method when sharing webinar leads or marketing data with external partners who do not have access to GitLab's standard partner portal.

### Security Requirements

#### Required Consent

Before sharing any lead data externally, ensure the data collection form includes explicit consent for external sharing:

1. **Primary consent** for GitLab to process personal data per the GitLab Privacy Statement
2. **Secondary consent** explicitly authorizing GitLab to share personal data with specified affiliates/partners

**Example consent language:**

> I agree to allow GitLab to share my personal data with its webinar affiliates as applicable, who may send you marketing communications in accordance with the affiliate's privacy policy.

#### Secure Sharing Process

1. **Upload** the lead data file to Google Drive
2. **Share using specific email invitation only**
   - Never use "Anyone with the link" sharing
   - Never use public sharing settings
   - Invite only the approved recipient's email address
3. **Set appropriate permissions**
   - Use "Viewer" access (not "Editor") unless editing is required
   - Avoid "Commenter" access for sensitive data
4. **Verify receipt**
   - Confirm the recipient has accessed and downloaded the file
5. **Revoke access immediately** after confirmation
   - Remove the recipient from the sharing list
   - Do not leave files shared indefinitely

### Best Practices

- Maintain an audit trail of what was shared, with whom, and when
- Limit data to only what is necessary for the partnership
- Review and remove old shared files regularly

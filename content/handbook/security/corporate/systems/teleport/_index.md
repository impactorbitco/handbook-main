Teleport is an Access Management Platform allowing users to gain read or write access to various resources. Teleport is owned by Infrastructure Security.

The [infrastructure runbook docs](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/tree/master/docs/teleport) contain a variety of detailed topics on using and interacting with teleport.

For help with:

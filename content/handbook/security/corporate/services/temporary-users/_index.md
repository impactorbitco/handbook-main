## What are Temporary Service Providers at GitLab?

Temporary Service Providers are team members that are provided by an outside vendor under an authorized contract, for a limited period of time.

## What is the Temporary Service Provider lifecycle process like?

Similar to our Access Request process for team members, we have an access request process for contingent workers, consultants or professional services providers. Temporary Service Provider requests need to go through the [Professional Services Procurement](/handbook/finance/procurement/) process before they can be onboarded.

## Hiring Manager Responsibilites

### Prior to Onboarding Contingent Workers

All steps below must be completed prior to any onboarding or access assignment.

* Procurement process must be completed. [How to submit a Zip request for a contingent worker](/handbook/finance/procurement/#how-to-start-the-procurement-process)
* PO approved in Coupa with a confirmed engagement end date.
* Security and Legal Reviews must be complete in Zip.
* Background checks complete if accessing [orange/red data](/handbook/security/policies_and_standards/data-classification-standard/)
* If accessing orange/red data, a GitLab issued laptop is required for your contingent worker. Laptops can be delivered to [these countries](/handbook/finance/procurement/contingent-worker-policy/#4-country-hiring-guidelines)
* Contingent worker accounts cannot be open ended and need to have an end date specified. The maximum length is 2 years.

>Please refer to the internal [Temporary Service Provider](https://internal.gitlab.com/handbook/it/end-user-services/access-request/temporary-service-providers/#during-the-engagementlifecycle) handbook page for laptop ordering, access requests and orientation information.

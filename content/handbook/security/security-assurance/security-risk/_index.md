description: "Security Risk Team Charter"

## Mission Statement

To drive security and technology risk treatment at GitLab by empowering teams to make informed and intelligent [decisions](/handbook/leadership/making-decisions/#making-decisions) through proactive identification, monitoring, prioritization, and reporting of security and technology risks.

## Value Proposition

We perform thorough, collaborative, and efficient risk assessments as well as drive risk reduction so that GitLab can achieve its goals while maintaining a high level of security.

## Core Competencies

### Security and Technology Operational Risk Management (STORM) Program{#storm}

The Security Risk team manages an integrated [Operational Risk Management](/handbook/security/security-assurance/security-risk/storm-program/) program focused on the identification, assessment, continuous monitoring, and reporting of Security and Technology Risks across the organization. Risk Reduction is 1 of 5 of the Security Department's operating principles ([Security Vision and Mission](/handbook/security/#i-classfas-fa-rocket-idbiz-tech-iconsi-security-vision-and-mission)). As such, the Security Risk Team takes a leading role in providing the information required by leadership to establish our Strategic Roadmap and support GitLab's [key initiatives](https://university.gitlab.com/learn/course/draft-fy26-company-memo/main/fy26-company-memo?client=internal-team-members&page=6) (internal only). Visit the [STORM Program & Procedures](/handbook/security/security-assurance/security-risk/storm-program/) handbook page for additional details including templates and how we integrate with other risk programs at GitLab.

Please refer to the [communication section of the STORM Program & Procedures](/handbook/security/security-assurance/security-risk/storm-program/#communication-of-risks-to-the-security-risk-team) page for information on the various ways that team members can use to escalate potential risks to the Security Risk Team.

### Security Third Party Risk Management (TPRM) Program{#tprm}

GitLab maintains an industry-leading [Third Party Risk Management (TPRM) Program](/handbook/security/security-assurance/security-risk/third-party-risk-management) through the use of automation, continuous monitoring, and deep integration across business functions to validate the security of GitLab data shared with external parties. The integration of GitLab's TPRM program within the vendor Procurement flow enables cross-functional [collaboration](/handbook/values/#collaboration) between Privacy, Legal, IT, and People Operations to facilitate [transparent](/handbook/values/#transparency), risk-based decision making, Business and Stakeholder-focused [Results](/handbook/values/#results), and adherence to GitLab's Regulatory and [Compliance Obligations](/handbook/security/security-assurance/security-compliance/certifications/). The vendor relationships maintained through this program are leveraged to create efficiencies across the organization.

### Business Impact Analysis (BIA) and Critical System Tiering (CST){#bia}

The [Business Impact Analysis](/handbook/security/security-assurance/security-risk/storm-program/business-impact-analysis/) (BIA) helps determine the systems critical to serving GitLab's Customers. The output of the BIA is the designation of a [Critical System Tier](/handbook/security/security-assurance/security-risk/storm-program/critical-systems/) (CST) for a new system by the Security Risk Team.

### Asset Inventory Maintenance{#asset-inventory}

Establishing a complete and accurate inventory of assets is key to the success of GitLab's Risk Program. As such, the Security Risk Team collaborates closely with IT and Business Owners to ensure new systems are added to the [Tech Stack](/handbook/business-technology/tech-stack-applications/#roles-and-responsibilities).

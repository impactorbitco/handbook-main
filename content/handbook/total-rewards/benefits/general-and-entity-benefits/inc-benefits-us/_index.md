## We've Got You Covered

**Clear benefits, real support**

At GitLab, we believe team member Benefits should be simple to understand and there when you need them. From life's big moments to everyday questions, our comprehensive coverage gives you clarity and confidence so you can focus on your work and life.

Whether you're planning for the future, starting a family, caring for aging parents, or dealing with unexpected challenges, GitLab's Benefit offerings are designed to support you at every stage of life—with comprehensive coverage and transparent information when you need it most.

**In addition to the benefits below, all team members have access to the [company-wide](/handbook/total-rewards/benefits/general-and-entity-benefits/) benefits.**

## 2026 Plan year

As the costs of healthcare increase, GitLab strives to offer a competitive benefits program and maintain low costs for Team Members. For 2026, GitLab will continue to cover the majority of costs for your total benefits package.

### 2026 Open Enrollment

GitLab’s US Benefit Open Enrollment for Calendar Year 2026 will take place from 2025-11-03 through 2025-11-14.

This year is a **passive enrollment**, meaning your current benefits will automatically continue into 2026. However, **FSA elections do not roll over - you must actively enroll in Flexible Spending Accounts (FSAs) and Dependent Care FSAs each year**, even if you are not making other changes.

To enroll in an FSA or make changes, [log in to PlanSource](https://www.myworkday.com/gitlab/d/inst/13102!CK5mGhIKBggDEMenAhIICgYI1A0QjAI~*wFIjauxgbeY~/cacheable-task/2997$2151.htmld) between Monday, November 3, and Friday, November 14.

## Supporting Life Transitions

### Flexible Spending & Health Savings Accounts

Tax-advantaged accounts to help manage healthcare and dependent care costs:

**Health Savings Account (HSA)**

GitLab contributes to your HSA each month: $100 for individual coverage and $125 for family coverage (team member + dependents). You must be enrolled in the High Deductible Health Plan (HDHP) to be eligible for HSA contributions and enrollment. Please see the [**US Benefits Guide**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15L8LMWI1CoUUoU3DcimxU3edITKs8QrV/view) for current year contribution limits.

<details markdown="1">
<summary>HSA Details</summary>

Your HSA lets you set aside pre-tax money for qualified medical expenses, reducing your overall healthcare costs.

**Key benefits:**

- **Tax advantages:** Contributions reduce taxable income, earnings grow tax-free, and withdrawals for medical expenses are tax-free
- **Flexible timing:** Money rolls over annually and never expires—it's yours forever
- **Investment options:** Once your balance reaches the minimum, you can invest in mutual funds, stocks, and bonds
- **Future flexibility:** At age 65, withdraw for any purpose without penalty (medical expenses remain tax-free)

</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary>HSA Account Rollover & Administration</summary>

**Transferring from a previous HSA:** Contact WEX (Discovery) at 866.451.3399 or customerservice@discoverybenefits.com to request a transfer form. Complete with your old provider's account information, WEX will handle the rest.

**If you leave GitLab:** Your HSA stays with you forever. You'll become responsible for the monthly administration fee once GitLab is no longer your employer.

**Domestic Partner Coverage:** If you're not legally married, your domestic partner's expenses aren't HSA-eligible. However, if they're covered under your family HDHP, they can open their own HSA. Both of you can contribute up to the full family maximum to your respective HSAs.

</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Mid-Year HSA Contribution Change</summary>

You can adjust your HSA contributions anytime throughout the year. Changes take effect on the 1st of the following month. Use the Qualifying Life Event Process and select "Mid-Year HSA Contribution."

**Front-loading contributions:** Contact WEX directly to front-load your portion of HSA contributions. Remember to:

- Include GitLab's contribution in your calculation
- Update your payroll deductions in PlanSource accordingly
- Track your own maximum contribution limits (GitLab can't monitor contributions made outside payroll)

</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Health Savings Account and Offboarding GitLab</summary>

Your HSA and all funds are yours to keep when you leave GitLab. You can continue using the money for eligible healthcare expenses at your next employer or let it grow over time.

WEX may charge management fees for direct account administration. Contact WEX (Discovery) at 866.451.3399, via live chat, or customerservice@discoverybenefits.com with questions.

</details>

**Flexible Spending Accounts**

FSAs let you pay for healthcare and dependent care expenses with pre-tax dollars. Set aside money from each paycheck based on your estimated annual expenses. Changes only allowed during open enrollment or qualifying life events. Please see the [**US Benefits Guide**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15L8LMWI1CoUUoU3DcimxU3edITKs8QrV/view) for current year contribution limits.

1. **Dependent Care FSA** Covers childcare and eldercare expenses. Qualifying dependents: children under 13, disabled spouse, or parents needing care. Claims incurred through March 15, submitted by March 31.

2. **Medical FSA** Covers medical, dental, vision, and over-the-counter medications. Cannot participate if you have an HSA.

3. **Limited Purpose FSA** Covers dental and vision only. Available if you have an HSA.

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Rollover Details for Medical and Limited Purpose FSA</summary>

Rollover funds from prior year won't be available until 5-15 business days after March 31 of the current tax year (no later than April 22).

**Contribution and Rollover Limits:**

<summary>Flexible Spending Accounts and Leaving GitLab</summary>

- **Claims deadline:** Submit all claims within 90 days of termination

**Questions?** Contact WEX (Discovery) at 866.451.3399 or customerservice@discoverybenefits.com

</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary>FSA Period to Submit Claims</summary>

You have 90 days after the plan year ends to submit claims (known as the runout period).

</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Mid-Year FSA Contribution Changes</summary>

You can only increase FSA contributions during a Qualifying Life Event; reductions aren't allowed. Additional funds can only be used for expenses incurred on or after your qualifying event date.

**Example:** If you originally elected $500 and increased it to $2,000 after getting married, you can only be reimbursed up to $500 for expenses before your marriage date. The additional $1,500 is available for expenses after your marriage.

</details>

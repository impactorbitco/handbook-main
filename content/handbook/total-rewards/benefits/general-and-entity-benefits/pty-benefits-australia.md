## **Financial Security**

### **Superannuation (Retirement Savings)**

Retirement savings that builds your financial future to help secure your long-term financial wellbeing.

<details markdown="1">
<summary>How Your Super Works</summary>

**GitLab's Contribution:**

- **Rate:** 12% of your total salary (effective July 1, 2025)
- **Quarterly cap:** $7,500 AUD maximum per quarter
- **Additional benefit:** Paid on top of your salary (not deducted from it)
- **Frequency:** Payments made at least quarterly (may be monthly)

**Your Super Fund:**

- Contributions paid directly to your nominated super fund
- Freedom to choose any compliant Australian super fund
- Contributions continue building your retirement savings automatically

**Payment Schedule:** Super payments are made at least quarterly by Australian Taxation Office requirements. Don't worry if payments aren't monthly—quarterly payments are completely normal and compliant.

</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Salary Sacrifice Option</summary>

**Boost Your Retirement Savings:** Make additional pre-tax contributions to superannuation, potentially reducing your taxable income while building your retirement savings.

**How It Works:**

- Choose a percentage or amount of pre-tax salary to contribute
- Combined total (GitLab + your contributions) must not exceed $30,000 per financial year
- Start from any month with next payroll processing

**Getting Started:**

1. Follow the instructions in the [Australia section](https://internal.gitlab.com/handbook/finance/payroll/#australia) of the Internal Payroll Handbook page under "Updating Changes to Superannuation Fund."
2. Contributions begin on the next available payroll
3. Modify or opt out anytime by following the [same process](https://internal.gitlab.com/handbook/finance/payroll/#australia)

**Important:** GitLab doesn't monitor annual limits—you're responsible for ensuring total contributions don't exceed $30,000 per financial year to avoid higher tax rates. The employer portion, however, stops once it reaches the quarterly cap

</details>

### **Workers' Compensation**

Comprehensive workplace injury protection across all Australian states and territories, ensuring you're covered if workplace-related injury or illness occurs.

</details>

### **Life Insurance**

## **Engineering-Specific Benefits**

### **On-Call Support (Engineering Only)**

Recognition and support for engineering team members participating in on-call rotations, ensuring proper rest and work-life balance while supporting GitLab's operations.

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Key Details</summary>

Certain groups in the Engineering division are expected to participate in on-call for business continuity and/or customer support. For more details on the on-call procedure, please reference the [on-call page](/handbook/engineering/on-call/). The purpose of this section is to provide an overview of **time in lieu that will be offered for the Development and Infrastructure departments effective February 1, 2021.** We will continue to review and implement to other departments within Engineering iteratively.

With our global team, we strive for a "follow the sun" model for on-call rotation. This way, team members can participate in on-call during their daytime rather than their nighttime in their respective regions (APAC, EMEA and AMER). In APAC, the majority of the team members are located in Australia. We want to ensure engineers in Australia are 1) eligible for on-call shifts, and 2) stay aligned with local laws to ensure proper rest/recovery time after on-call shifts.

Engineers based in Australia who are part of the Development and Infrastructure departments will be eligible for time in lieu after on-call shifts. Time in lieu is time off from work that is granted to team members to work outside of standard working hours (I.E. ordinary hours).

</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Time in Lieu Compensation</summary>

**Who's Eligible:**

- Development and Infrastructure department engineers
- Participating in on-call rotations outside normal working hours

**Compensation Structure:**

- **4-hour shift:** ½ day time in lieu
- **8-hour shift:** 1 day time in lieu
- **24-hour shift:** 3 days time in lieu

**Important Guidelines:**

- The full shift (state of readiness) is compensated by time in lieu - rather than only the "actual time worked"
- Time in lieu must be taken within 2 weeks of shift completion
- For weekend shifts please be particularly mindful about managing your time to **ensure you are not exceeding a 38 hour work-week**,
- Use flexible PTO policy for additional time off if needed

**How to Request:** Request time in lieu through Workday by selecting "Time Off in Lieu" under the Time Offs dropdown menu.

</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary>FAQ</summary>

**When can time in lieu be taken?**

Time in lieu should be taken *within 2 weeks after completion of the on-call shift*. We want to ensure that time in lieu is taken close to the on-call shift to ensure that team members have sufficient time to rest.

**Do all on-call shifts result in time in lieu?**

No, only on-call shifts outside of working hours (I.E. weekends, evenings, etc.). *Please note that not all teams require weekend or evening on-call shifts, so this may not be applicable for all.*

**How do I request time in lieu?**

Time in lieu should be requested via Workday by selecting the `Time Off in Lieu` under the `Time Offs` dropdown menu option.

</details>

## Workplace Rights & Policies

### **Right to Disconnect**

Your workplace right to disconnect from work communications outside normal working hours, supporting healthy work-life balance and well-being.

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Your Rights & Support</summary>

At GitLab (the "Company"), we care about the safety, health, and well-being of all team members and focus not on hours worked but rather on [asynchronous communication](/handbook/values/#bias-towards-asynchronous-communication) and results. We believe that [family and friends come first and work comes second](/handbook/values/#family-and-friends-first-work-second). In line with the Company's values, we understand that "[unplugging](/handbook/company/culture/all-remote/mental-health/#your-rest-ethic-is-as-important-as-your-work-ethic)" from work is essential to a [healthy and balanced life](/handbook/company/culture/all-remote/). Technological advancements, global events, and work demands can sometimes make us forget that we need a break to recharge.

Team members are expected to disconnect from work and work-related communications outside of normal working hours and during PTO and there are many suggestions in the Handbook for [communicating when you will be away](/handbook/people-group/time-off-and-absence/time-away-philosophy/#communicating--preparing-for-planned-time-away) so other people can manage their time efficiently, projects don't slip through the cracks, and so that team members are not disturbed while away.

This guidance reminds team members in Australia of their workplace right to disconnect (codified from 26 August 2024) and how the Company is committed to supporting team members in doing so.

The right to disconnect means that a team member is not required, outside of their working hours, to monitor, read or respond to contact, or attempted contact, from an employer or a third party (where the contact relates to their work), unless it would be unreasonable to refuse.

In addition to the suggestions for communicating when you will be away, take a look at these tips to increase a team member's ability to disconnect from work:

- unsubscribe from any MRs that will likely resolve while you're away, and then you won't have to deal with all the emails from them when you return;
- set up some email filters to move emails into buckets that you can address one-at-a-time when you return;
- disconnect yourself from Slack and Gmail in any of these ways (*note: Workday is supposed to turn off Slack notifications on your phone and set DND mode):
  - log out from Slack and Gmail on your phone, or
  - remove Slack and Gmail from your phone, or
  - pause the Slack and Gmail apps on your phone, or
  - manually configure Slack and Gmail not to send notifications on your phone

At GitLab, team members should communicate respectfully and professionally at all times, in line with the Company's values, with a bias towards asynchronous communication and documentation-first and should [assume positive intent in dealings with others](/handbook/values/#assume-positive-intent) (including in relation to the tone and timing of communications).

In considering whether contact is unreasonable, think about:

- the reason for contact;
- how contact might be made and the level of disruption contact may cause;
- the extent to which the team member is being compensated (eg with time off after an on-call rotation):
  - to remain available to perform work during the period in which contact is made; or
  - for working additional hours outside of their ordinary hours of work;
- the nature of the team member's role and their level of responsibility; and
- the team member's personal circumstances.

In case of an issue arising relating to whether a team member has reasonably (or unreasonably) refused to monitor or respond to contact, the team members involved are encouraged to raise the issue with their manager or contact [Team Member Relations](mailto:teammemberrelations@gitlab.com).

The FWC will update all modern awards to incorporate the right to disconnect in due course and awards can be checked [here](https://www.fwc.gov.au/work-conditions/awards/find-award).

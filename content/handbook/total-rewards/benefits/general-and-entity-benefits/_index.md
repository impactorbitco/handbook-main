#### Your 4th Trimester

**This benefit is currently on hold. We are transitioning to a new vendor and will share more soon!**

[Your 4th Trimester](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NOkpt1oBruKunt3IdR6bQuvR0P2ht6Tg/view) is a 90-day coaching program to help parents transition back to work.

#### Tips for a smoother transition

GitLab team members compiled tips in a four-part blog series, linked below, looking at an array of issues surrounding working remotely with children. These shed light on parental leave policies worldwide, provide an inside view of working at GitLab with a newborn, and highlight strategies for working remotely with older children.

1. [Parental/maternity leave around the world – how does your country stack up?](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2019/07/18/how-is-it-being-a-new-mom-working-for-gitlab/)
1. [How I balance a baby, a career at GitLab, and cultural expectations of motherhood](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2019/07/25/balancing-career-and-baby/)
1. [How to make your home a space that works with kids](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2019/08/01/working-remotely-with-children-at-home/)
1. [5 Things to keep in mind while working remotely with kids](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2019/08/08/remote-kids-part-four/)

Tips from GitLab team members are the greater community are below, as well as how each aligns with at least one of [GitLab's values](/handbook/values/).

> What has worked for me is to integrate GitLab into my life, and not the other way around. I set very clear boundaries in my calendar of when is work time and when is family time. Per GitLab's [recommendation](/handbook/communication/#google-calendar), my calendar is viewable by anyone and clearly has time for: `kids test prep`, `visual therapy for one`, `judo pick-up` and other appointments I have outside of work. This prevents team members from scheduling over these instances.
>
> If someone *does* schedule over family time or personal time, I feel confident to decline, unless it is very urgent and I'm blocking it (I always suggest a new time first, before using family time for a meeting). I am also inclined to say that if folks keep scheduling outside of your work time, to make sure you [respond back and highlight that](/handbook/values/#transparency), and check if you can find an alternative time that works for both of you. — [*Nadia V.*](https://gitlab.com/Vatalidis)

Nadia's recommendation leans on [Transparency](/handbook/values/#transparency), as well as an important operating principle of [Efficiency](/handbook/values/#efficiency): [Be respectful of others' time](/handbook/values/#be-respectful-of-others-time).

> When I joined GitLab, it was great to see things in people's calendars like `baby time`, `homework with kids`, `date night`, etc. Part of [onboarding](/handbook/company/culture/all-remote/getting-started/) was [coffee chats](/handbook/company/culture/all-remote/informal-communication/#coffee-chats) so I saw these "meetings" on calendars as I tried to schedule chats. It reinforced our [family first operating principle](/handbook/values/#family-and-friends-first-work-second), and also normalized these activities. It helped me understand that I could set up similar boundaries and not sacrifice bed time or something similar just to have an empty hour on my calendar. — [*Seth B.*](https://gitlab.com/sethgitlab)

Seth's recommendation ties to an operating principle of Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging : [Family and friends first, work second](/handbook/values/#family-and-friends-first-work-second).

> The hardest part of coming back from parental leave has been getting caught up/reintegrating with the GitLab team while sleep deprived. I recommend taking to heart the `don't worry` portion of GitLab's guide to paid time off, which states: "You don't need to worry about taking time off to go to the gym, take a nap, go grocery shopping, do household chores, help someone, take care of a loved one, etc. If you have urgent tasks, but something comes up or takes longer than expected, just ensure the rest of the team **knows** and someone can pick up the tasks (assuming you're able to communicate)." — [*Jonathan S.*](https://gitlab.com/jschafer)

Jonathan's recommendation adds a layer of nuance to [Have Ownership & Accountability](/handbook/values/#have-ownership--accountability), an operating principle of [Results](/handbook/values/#results). It also touches on [Give agency](/handbook/values/#give-agency), an operating principle of [Collaboration](/handbook/values/#collaboration), which empowers team members to focus on what they think is most beneficial.

> Take advantage of GitLab's bias towards [asynchronous communication](/handbook/company/culture/all-remote/). A child's schedule shifts rapidly, and I've found it useful to structure my days around my son's routine rather than force him to operate on a rigid timeline. Being a part of a [100% remote team](/handbook/company/culture/all-remote/) empowers team members to [embrace work/life harmony](/handbook/company/culture/all-remote/) in whatever way suits them. Moreover, it's liberating to be able to shift when and where I work depending on the needs of my family.
>
> It's important to talk about family. For a company to sustain a culture that embraces parents and empathizes with the associated needs, these realities must be shared in the open and not allowed to become taboo. — [*Darren M.*](https://gitlab.com/dmurph)

### Team Member Toolkit

Parents at GitLab who are reentering work following parental leave are encouraged to read the [Team Member Tool Kit](/handbook/total-rewards/benefits/parental-leave-toolkit/#team-member-tool-kit) and to reach out to team members who self-designate as a [Parental Leave Reentry Buddy](/handbook/total-rewards/benefits/parental-leave-toolkit/#parental-leave-reentry-buddies).

Managers of soon to be parents should check out this [Manager Tool Kit](https://theloop.gitlab.com/site/5ea8f77b-a0c3-4983-ba40-1463a96d8e21/page/772afb15-974d-4798-a383-fd7b49ca724d) for best practices in supporting your team members as they prepare for and return from Parental Leave.

If you're interested in learning about how other GitLab team members approach parenthood, take a look at [the parenting resources wiki page](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gitlab-team-member-resources/wikis/parenting) and [#intheparenthood](https://gitlab.slack.com/messages/CHADS8G12/) on Slack.

## GitLab Cares - Team Member Disaster Relief Program

When Team Members are affected by natural disasters such as fires, earthquakes, floods, etc..., GitLab has established a Team Member Relief Program to assist with financial hardship from these disasters or other emergencies. This program is managed in partnership with E4E Relief, a non-profit that helps businesses establish global disaster relief programs for their Team Members.

This program provides Team Members and their families with short-term, need-based assistance in times of extreme need. If you experience a difficult situation, please visit the [GitLab Cares Portal](https://gitlab.e4erelief.org/) to easily determine if you're eligible for program assistance and to apply for assistance.

GitLab started the fund with an initial contribution to support team members. Team Members may also choose to make donations to the fund as part of their annual giving and donation efforts. If you wish to make a donation, please visit the Portal and select 'Contribute to the Fund'. Donations are tax-deductable (country-specific tax laws apply).

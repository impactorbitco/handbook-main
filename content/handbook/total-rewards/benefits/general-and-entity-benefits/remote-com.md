<summary>Brazil Statutory Leave policies</summary>

Below is the information related to Brazil's statutory leave policies. Please note that team members hired in Brazil are hired via Remote (PEO) and you should always check with Remote first for the most up to date information.

**Annual leave**

Brazil has specific requirements that govern statutory leave to remain compliant. For reference, after 12 months of service, you are entitled to 30 calendar days of paid time off. Team members are also eligible for [GitLab's paid time off policy](/handbook/people-group/time-off-and-absence/time-off-types/). If the time off taken falls under the requirements for statutory time then the time off will automatically be deducted from the statutory allowance first (you may see this reflected as "dummy days" on your pay slip).

If the time off does not fall under the requirements it will be used as Flex Time Off, then once you have exhausted the full statutory leave allowance all ongoing time off will be Flex Time Off per GitLab policy.

Please keep the below in mind before [submitting your time off request via Workday or the Workday Slack App](/handbook/people-group/time-off-and-absence/time-away-philosophy/#communicating--preparing-for-planned-time-away).

- Vacations can only be divided in up to 3 periods. One of the vacation periods must be at least 14 days long, while the other two vacation periods need to be at least five days long each.
- Team members cannot start their vacation two days before a holiday or a weekend as per the leave rules in Brazil. This means the team member cannot start their vacation on Thursday or Friday under the Statutory Leave allowance.
- Vacations earned must be taken during the concession period and cannot be accumulated or carried over to the following year.
- Team members are required to submit their time off request with at least 30 days' notice. Although, we recommend team members submit their time off request 45 days in advance (this is to ensure accuracy and reporting for statutory compliance).
- Our GitLab Payroll Team sends a time off report (past and current month) to the PEO vendor on a monthly basis to ensure their processing of your vacation bonus two days before you go on vacation.
- Conversion into cash: 1/3 of vacations (10 days) can be converted into cash upon request to the PEO vendor. The funds will be paid on the last period of vacation days taken.
- Team members will be provided the "Aviso de Férias" document from the PEO vendor which will need to be returned with signature (this document will be provided via the PEO portal).

If you need further information on the laws that govern vacation days in Brazil, please visit the [Remote Help Center](https://support.remote.com/hc/en-us/sections/8577490511885-Statutory-Leave-in-Brazil) or reach out to [help@remote.com](mailto:help@remote.com)

<details markdown="1">
<summary>How to Enroll/Access</summary>

- Automatic enrollment—you'll receive a welcome pack within 14 days after payroll processing
- Access your account at Scottish Widows [Portal](https://www.scottishwidows.co.uk/personal)
- Increase contributions via [HelpLab](https://helplab.gitlab.systems/esc?id=emp_taxonomy_topic&topic_id=7b018859478c069067429ee0026d4352)

The following process is followed by GitLab People Operations to enroll the team member under the pension scheme during onboarding:

1. During onboarding, the Payroll Team informs Papaya Payroll of a new hire that joined the company in the UK.
2. Once Papaya payroll has this information, the employee will be set up on the payroll and added to the pension file for Scottish Widows in preparation to be uploaded.
3. The pension file is sent to Scottish Widows around the end of 6th of each month and will include any joiners/changes/leavers from the previous month’s payroll run. For example everyone who has been included on the pension file in October (the cut off is 15th October) Scottish Widows will be notified around 6th November
4. Any team member who joins after 20th or has not been included on the pension file will be picked up in the following month’s file.
5. Scottish Widows receive the pension file around 6th of each month and will process all joiners/changes/leavers accordingly.
6. New joiners should expect to receive their welcome pack in the mail within 14 working days after Scottish Widows receives the pension file.
7. When a team member joins the scheme they will be sent a welcome pack in the post stating that they are now a scheme member, it will also have their login details. Team members can login to access their own personal fund and can make adjustments as they see fit.
8. If the team member hasn’t received their Scottish Widows package in the mail within their first 2 months of their joining date, they can log on to their Scottish Widows [Portal](https://www.scottishwidows.co.uk/personal). Select “Register Now’, and fill out your details (no need to fill out the Policy Number, as you can use your National Insurance Number instead). Please do not try to log in via the portal before Papaya has uploaded your information in accordance to the schedule above, as you will be denied access.

</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Salary Sacrifice</summary>

Save on National Insurance contributions while building your pension. Team members hired after 13 December 2022 are automatically enrolled. Earlier hires can opt in via [HelpLab](https://helplab.gitlab.systems/esc?id=emp_taxonomy_topic&topic_id=a3e7bb0d474c069067429ee0026d4328).

**Salary Sacrifice FAQ**

- Can we change the amount during the period we’re contracted for salary exchange?
  - Yes it is possible to change the amount/increase your employee percent

- What happens if our ‘actual’ salary changes during the period?
  - Your employee contribution is a percent of basic pay so if your basic pay increases the pension contribution will too.

- What happens if we receive a discretionary bonus?
  - Your definition of pensionable pay is basic salary the percent will not automatically be applied to the bonus. Should you wish to contribute part of you bonus to your pension pot you can do that.
- Is it possible to start from any month?
  - Yes it is; it would be processed on the next available payroll.

</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Pension Contribution Percentages</summary>

The certification level that has been chosen is basic salary only and will not include commission, bonuses or any over time payments. The contributions will be paid monthly and will be shown on the pay-slips.

- From April 6, 2019 to a minimum of:
  - Team Member: 5% of basic salary
  - GitLab: 4% of basic salary

- As your contribution is a percentage of your pay, the amounts will automatically increase or decrease in accordance with your basic pay. These contributions will be taken from your pay and will include tax relief.

- You may increase the contribution percentage you pay by contacting the Non US Payroll team via [HelpLab](https://helplab.gitlab.systems/esc?id=emp_taxonomy_topic&topic_id=7b018859478c069067429ee0026d4352). Please note the company contribution will remain fixed as above. The standard Annual Allowance for the 2025/2026 year is £60,000 p.a. The Annual Allowance includes all contributions, both employer and employee payable to the pension plan in the tax year. You may carry forward unused Annual Allowance for up to three tax years. Your Annual Allowance will be reduced if your Adjusted Income exceeds £260,000 or if you ‘flexibly access’ pension benefits from a Defined Contribution pension arrangement. Please see the [Annual Allowance Fact Sheet](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MMA-0wfzUsO70pBsweDAHK-FVc-P_iR1/view?usp=sharing).

- These percentages are gross percentages using the [relief at source](https://www.gov.uk/workplace-pensions/managing-your-pension) method. As basic rate tax relief is then added by the pension provider, the amount on your payslip will typically be the net amount, which is 80% of the employee’s contribution.

These contribution percentages are in line with [The Pension Regulator’s Auto-enrollment legislation](https://www.thepensionsregulator.gov.uk/en/document-library/automatic-enrolment-detailed-guidance). Should the government’s minimum contribution standards change further GitLab will contact you to advise the new levels to comply with legislation.

</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Opting Out</summary>

If you decide to opt out of the scheme you can do this within one month of the enrollment date by following the instructions in the information from Scottish Widows. The Opt Out deadlines are:

- You have four weeks from when the Scottish Widows welcome letter is dated.
- If you do opt out by this date, any contributions that have already been taken from your pay will be returned to you and you’ll be treated as if you had never joined the pension scheme.
- If you don’t opt out by this date, you can stop contributing at any time, in accordance with the pension scheme rules. If you do this, both your contributions and GitLab’s, up to that point, will remain invested in your pension pot until you take your benefits.
- You can opt-out by completing the [Scottish Widows Opt-out form](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FDCXW2qa3pniHIbkJ4vSkK-C_KGmLiNa/view?usp=sharing) for Group Pension Scheme. The form must be completed, then returned to Total Rewards at total-rewards@gitlab.com
- The pension provider will also be able to tell you when the one month opt-out period started, if you aren’t sure.
- An opt-out from the pension scheme normally lasts for three years. If you’ve opted out, or stopped contributions to the scheme, GitLab is required to automatically enroll you into the scheme at a later date (normally every three years).

</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Re-joining</summary>

If you decide to re-join the scheme you can do so by submitting a HelpLab [ticket](https://helplab.gitlab.systems/esc?id=emp_taxonomy_topic&topic_id=a3e7bb0d474c069067429ee0026d4328). You will be asked to write a letter or send an email from your personal email address. The letter will need to include the phrase I confirm I personally submitted this notice to join a workplace pension scheme. You can only re-join once in any 12 month period.

</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Changing the Pension Scheme Investment Approach</summary>

There’s a workplace pension webpage linked from this [document](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1e38np_Q8_s9Ty5JdbXTiMFXYVPTa20UQ/view?usp=sharing) that contains information about all the options available.

When your policy is first set up, it’ll be set to:

- ‘Pension Investment Approach’ (PIA)
- A lifestyle switching approach for managing your investments as you approach retirement.
- A default investment fund (such as ‘Scottish Widows Pension Portfolio Two Pension’)

The [policy website](https://personal.secure.scottishwidows.co.uk/) will tell you:
Although you are currently invested in a Pension Investment Approach you also have other options such as investing in our range of individual funds or changing to a Premier Pension Investment Approach.

Read about all these investment options, and the funds available, on the [workplace pension webpage](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1e38np_Q8_s9Ty5JdbXTiMFXYVPTa20UQ/view?usp=sharing).

Changing your investment approach or funds could adversely affect your retirement income. Get advice, such as from [Oakley Financial](/handbook/total-rewards/benefits/general-and-entity-benefits/ltd-benefits-uk/).

**Selecting funds online**
This is an advanced feature that carries significant risk. For team-members comfortable with this, it’s not obvious how to enable it.

To access ‘investing in our range of individual funds’ online you need to call Scottish Widows, and ask:

- To come out of the lifestyle approach.
- To come out of ‘Pension Investment Approach’ (PIA)
- For online access to the range of funds.

The change may take a couple of days to come into effect, and they’ll write and confirm the change.

Having enabled online fund management, you can search for and select the funds on the [policy website](https://personal.secure.scottishwidows.co.uk/). The [workplace pension page](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1e38np_Q8_s9Ty5JdbXTiMFXYVPTa20UQ/view?usp=sharing) also has a link to a fund list, plus a PDF which explains:

- The different groups of funds Scottish Widows offers.
- A summary of each fund.
- A fund fact sheet is provided for each fund with usual information such as previous performance.

Management charges vary by fund and are not on the fact sheets: use the charges sheet tool on the [workplace pension page](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1e38np_Q8_s9Ty5JdbXTiMFXYVPTa20UQ/view?usp=sharing).

## **Financial Security**

### **KiwiSaver (Pension)**

New Zealand's retirement savings scheme designed to build your financial security, with GitLab contributing on top of your salary to support your long-term financial wellbeing.

</details>

### **Life Insurance Information**

GitLab does not plan at this time to offer Life Insurance benefits because New Zealanders can access [government payments and services](https://www.workandincome.govt.nz/providers/health-and-disability/helping-people-into-work/index.html) to help if they get ill, injured or have a disability.

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Available Support</summary>

New Zealanders can access [government payments and services](https://www.workandincome.govt.nz/providers/health-and-disability-practitioners/health-and-disability-related-benefits.html) for illness, injury, or disability support.

Many New Zealanders choose to access life insurance through their KiwiSaver provider or other personal arrangements.

</details>

## **Engineering-Specific Benefits**

### **On-Call Support (Engineering Only)**

Compliance with New Zealand employment law for on-call work, including required compensation for public holiday work and overtime situations.

<details markdown="1">
<summary>On-Call Support Key Details</summary>

New Zealand employment law requires that work on a formal [Public Holiday](https://www.govt.nz/browse/work/public-holidays-and-work/public-holidays-and-anniversary-dates/), including [on-call](https://www.employment.govt.nz/leave-and-holidays/public-holidays/alternative-holidays), is compensated with time-in-lieu. Overtime pay is also required in certain situations, for example: whether the on-call shift fell on a "normal" working day or not, and whether the team member was called to work during their on-call shift. The policy linked above covers for the [time-in-lieu requirement](/handbook/total-rewards/benefits/general-and-entity-benefits/pty-benefits-new-zealand/#on-call-support-engineering-only) but we do not yet have a set mechanism for handling overtime pay requirements.

New Zealand-based team members **may not be on-call on a New Zealand Public Holiday**, and must seek/find a replacement for any shifts where they may be indicated as being on call on a Public Holiday. To ensure we remain compliant with local laws we team members to consider local laws when volunteering for/accepting shifts.

The process is as follows:

1. When scheduling we should avoid on-call taking/assigning on-call shifts on Public Holidays. A "Public Holiday" will be deemed as any day included in the official holidays on [this website](https://www.govt.nz/browse/work/public-holidays-and-work/public-holidays-and-anniversary-dates/).

2. If a team member is assigned for an on-call shift that falls on a Public Holiday, they need to align with their manager and try to find a replacement for that shift.

If it's impossible to find a replacement and the team member ends up taking the on-call shift on a Public Holiday, the process to follow is:

- Team member should obtain manager approval for taking the shift.
- If the team member is not called in to work during their on-call shift, a regular time-in-lieu compensation for the shift should be applied.
- If the team member is called in to work during their on call shift, they are responsible for recording their hours worked during the shift and report to payroll/manager in order for overtime payment processing.

*Note: To stay in compliance with local laws we would follow [the New Zealand government website](https://www.employment.govt.nz/leave-and-holidays/public-holidays/public-holidays-rights-for-employees#scroll-to-7) with regards to compensation for worked time during on-call.*

</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Garden Leave</summary>

A GitLab team member may use Garden Leave when they have provided their resignation and a Garden Leave is mutually agreed upon by both the team member and GitLab. Team members can not be forced to take a Garden Leave, but both the team member and GitLab may find it useful in the following situations:

- The team member has access to commercially sensitive information and is going to be working for a competitor at the end of their notice period. Any limit of trade provision would take effect after the employee's employment ends.

However, employers should be aware that if an employee's employment agreement contains both a garden leave provision and a restraint of trade provision, the period the employee is on garden leave may be taken into consideration in working out whether or not the restraint of trade provision is reasonable (and therefore enforceable). The restraint of trade provision takes effect after the end of the garden leave period.

- Is distracting other team members while they're in their notice period
- Is being made redundant and the employer is not requiring them to report to work during their notice period so they can look for other job opportunities while they can still say they're currently employed
- Has been dismissed on notice and their presence is creating an uncomfortable atmosphere for everyone.

</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Leave Without Pay</summary>

Leave without pay is when GitLab allows an team member time off work when they would otherwise be working, but doesn't pay them for this time. Leave without pay (LWOP) doesn't end an team member's employment, and usually the team member returns to their same position and terms and conditions after taking leave without pay (unless the employee and team member agree otherwise). Leave without pay can affect the employee's annual holidays payment and entitlement in some situations.

- Team members must designate this time off as `Out Sick` in Workday.

For more information regarding Leave without Pay, please review the [Employment New Zealand's website](https://www.employment.govt.nz/leave-and-holidays/other-types-of-leave/leave-without-pay).

</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Long Service Leave</summary>

While not a legal requirement, long service leave may be negotiated between a team member and GitLab as additional entitlements under their employment agreement.

- This leave runs concurrently with GitLab PTO. Team members must designate this time off as `Paid Time Off` in Workday.

## Engineering Quarterly Achievers

Quarterly, CTO Leadership will recognize Engineering team members who have excelled in a given quarter. Winners are selected from nominations submitted by their peers. Winners are announced at the Engingeering All Hands. Recognition includes:

- an invitation to the [Engineering Quarterly Achievers Chat](#engineering-quarterly-achievers-chat)
- participation in the [Engineering Quarterly Achiever's Recognition Dinner](#engineering-quarterly-achievers-recognition-dinner) - an expensed meal for yourself, friends and family to celebrate your work.

### Engineering Quarterly Achiever's Chat

The Quarterly Achiever's Chat recognizes Engineering team members who have excelled in a given quarter by inviting them to join the Chief Technology Officer and 2 members of E-Group in a congratulatory chat. The benefit is three-fold:

1. Top performers receive facetime and recognition directly at the executive level
1. Knowledge sharing of best practices that can be replicated by other Engineering team members
1. Leaders/teams outside of the Engineering organization gain visibility into successes

Key features of this call include:

- 30-minute call
- Held within first two months of new quarter
- CTO and 2 E-Group Members attendance required
- Not recorded

### Engineering Quarterly Achiever's Recognition Dinner

As part of this initiative, Engineering Quarterly Achievers are able to expense a meal up to $250.00 USD

The meal must occur and be expensed before the last day of the quarter following the announcement of their win. Each winner will be messaged individually by the program DRI Liki Simonot to let them know what is the last day of the quarter for expensing.
Winners may submit their receipt for reimbursement via Navan.

Expensing Instructions:

1. In Navan, click Add Transaction Select Upload receipt (or select Type in details)
2. Under Expense Type field, please select "Team events & meals"
3. Under Classification, please select "FY26 Team Building"
4. Under Description field, please include this link: https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/recognition/#engineering-quarterly-achievers-recognition-dinner
5. Click Submit (or Save & close if you need to come back to add more information).

The $250.00 USD is reimbursable for a meal only, other items do not qualify.

### Engineering Quarterly Achievers Nominations

Team members can nominate a peer for an award using [this submission form](https://forms.gle/CEBWJwgSNhp9PDi68) at any time.
You may nominate as many people as you wish, provided the meet the selection criteria:

1. The team member operates within GitLab and in their particular area of achievement in concordance with [GitLab Values](/handbook/values/)
1. The team member has not won a Quarterly Achiever award within the current fiscal year

Add all relevant information to the text of your nomination – adding a link as SSOT is great, but ideally a nomination shouldn't require clicking through to anything to be understood and evaluated. Be aware that the text (but not your name!) may be shared with the nominee.

### Winners Announcement

Winners will be announced at the Engineering All Hands. The program DRI Liki Simonot will also reach out individually to each winner, providing details on the winners chat, and guidelines on when / how to expense their dinner. If a team member is on leave during this process, they can communicate with Liki on joining a future winners chat, and when to expense their meal.

## Engineering Quarterly Achievers Process

This process is followed by a delegate of the CTO Leads team

### Engineering Quarterly Achievers Timeline

1. Engineering Quarterly Achievers selected within the first week of the new quarter by CTO leadership
1. Engineering Quarterly Achievers announced and recognized in the Engineering All-Hands
1. Program DRI reaches out to all winners to share details of the winners chat and dinner.
1. Engineering Quarterly Achievers Chat held within the quarter of announcement
1. CTO and 2 E-Group Members congratulate and inquire about key learnings from achievers on call

### Communicating

1. Create a Field Operations - Enablement issue ([example](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/sales-team/field-operations/enablement/-/issues/2394)) to get permission to post in `#field-fyi` for the "Contribution to Sales or Renewal" Award. This should be completed at least 2 weeks prior to launching the nomination period.
   - Consider posting a pre-filled link that selects that specific award.
1. In the Engineering Week in Review, add a note that nominations are open with a link to the form.
1. Make a Slack post in `#engineering-fyi`. Cross-post in `#cto`, and `#eng-managers`.
1. Consider posting reminders 1 week, and 1 day before due date.

### Selecting Winners

1. Pull the raw data from the nominations sheet and put it in a copy of `Engineering Quarterly Achievers Nominees Selection - TEMPLATE`. It's easier to collaborate on a Google Doc than a Google Sheet.
   - You can consider using `process-quarterly-achievers.rb` to process the data.
1. Make a copy of the `Engineering Quarterly Achievers All Hands Deck - TEMPLATE`
1. Follow the instructions in the template:
   - Choose DRIs for each area from among CTO Leads
   - Empower CTO Leads to make decisions
   - Direct CTO Leads to update the deck with names, photos and speaker notes that highlight the nomination.

### Announce Winners

For the next All-Hands, incorporate the final slides into primary deck! After All-hands, update this page with names of winners. Wooo! You're done until next quarter.

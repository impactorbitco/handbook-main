## Operating Principles

### Customer-Centric Excellence

* **Clear Expectations First**: Every engagement begins with explicit alignment on migration cadence, platform capabilities, and service model boundaries  
* **Consultative Partnership**: We act as trusted advisors, not order-takers, providing honest guidance even when difficult  
* **Transparent Communication**: Regular, structured updates with no surprises \- customers always know where they stand

### Technical Rigor

* **Discovery Before Design**: Comprehensive technical and business discovery drives all solution approaches  
* **Validation at Every Step**: Multi-layered validation ensures accuracy before any production changes  
* **Automation Where Possible**: Standardized, repeatable processes reduce risk and improve consistency

### Structured Delivery

* **Milestone-Driven Progress**: Clear checkpoints with customer sign-off prevent scope creep and misalignment  
* **Risk-First Planning**: Identify and mitigate risks early rather than hope for the best  
* **Documentation as Code**: Every process, decision, and artifact is documented for repeatability and knowledge transfer

### Continuous Improvement

* **Learning Organization**: Every project contributes to improved processes, tools, and methodologies  
* **Cross-Functional Collaboration**: Regular feedback loops with Engineering, Product, and Customer Success teams  
* **Scalable Solutions**: Build capabilities that enable future self-service and automation

### Internal Alignment

* **One Team Approach**: Clear role definitions with flexible collaboration across disciplines  
* **Shared Accountability**: Success is measured at the team level, not individual contribution  
* **Proactive Communication**: Internal stakeholders are informed and aligned before customer commitments

### Success Metrics

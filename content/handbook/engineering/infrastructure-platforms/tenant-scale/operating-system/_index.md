## What

The Group Tenant Scale Operating System serves as our team's central framework for consistent, effective, low-friction  engineering management practices. This document provides clear guidance on:
    - Performance metrics and measurement approaches
    - Project management methodologies and workflows
    - Alignment with broader organizational processes
    - Performance management protocols and best practices
    - Career development pathways and growth opportunities

Think of it as our shared operating manual—a collection of principles, processes, and expectations that create a common understanding of how our engineering organization functions.

## Why

Engineering excellence requires more than technical skill—it demands thoughtful management systems that enable our teams to perform at their best. This Operating System:

- **Creates consistency** across engineering teams, ensuring fair and equitable treatment
- **Aligns expectations** between managers, reports, and leadership
- **Streamlines decision-making** through established frameworks
- **Accelerates onboarding** for new managers joining our organization
- **Eliminates ambiguity** around performance standards and career progression
- **Fosters a culture** of continuous improvement and professional growth

By providing this clear structure, we allow our leadership team to focus on what truly matters: supporting our teams, delivering exceptional results, and developing the next generation of engineering talent.

## Support Rotation Handover Prompt

Here is a prompt than can be used in Duo Agentic mode to summarise the work on
an issue which has not yet been closed, in order to hand it over to another
engineer. Execute this prompt and you can copy the response into the handover
notes when another colleague begins their support rotation:

### Prompt text

```text
Please concisely summarize the current status of this issue, in order to hand it
over to the next backend engineer on customer support rotation duty for the
Groups & Projects team.

Use this template:

A handover comment generated by Duo and reviewed by me:

### Current status

This is a **regression** in GitLab 18.3 where the `last_repository_check_failed`
URL parameter filter is not working in the admin projects page. The issue was
identified as being caused by the `admin_projects_vue` feature flag migration -
when the flag is enabled, the parameter is ignored and all projects are returned
instead of filtering for projects with failed repository checks.

@smaglangit has taken ownership of this issue and is actively working on a fix.
The issue is currently in **workflow::in dev** status and has been linked to [#561340](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/561340) (the feature flag cleanup
issue) as a blocking dependency. Multiple merge requests have been referenced
(!203618, !203621, !204306) indicating active development work.

The issue affects customers on GitLab 18.3.1 and has been reproduced on v18.3.
It's scheduled for the 18.4 milestone (release date: September 18, 2025) with
only 2 days remaining until code cutoff.

*Confidence: 95%*

### Action items

- @smaglangit (*Confidence: 100%*): Complete the fix for the
  `last_repository_check_failed` filter regression as part of the
  admin_projects_vue feature flag migration work. (*Confidence: 95%*)
- @smaglangit (*Confidence: 90%*): Ensure the fix is included in the 18.4
  milestone given the tight timeline (code cutoff in 2 days). (*Confidence: 85%*)

starter questions to ask a customer before further development can happen:

## Epic Summary Prompt

This prompt can be used to ask Duo to look at an individual epic and summarise
the most recent changes and blockers in the last week. Use it to formulate a
weekly status update message which is readable and easy to dig into for links.

### Prompt text

```text
Generate a status update for this Epic using the following format.
The "Achievements" section should highlight any issues closed within the last 7
days since the last status update, with a short (1-2 sentence) summary of what
the issue accomplishes for customers. "Blockers" can be either left empty,
or use any issues whose status is blocked. For the "Next" section, include any
issues that have an assignee and have the status "in dev" or "in review".

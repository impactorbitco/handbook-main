title: "Weekly Async Updates"
description: "Defines the process for how we use weekly asynchronous issue updates"
---

We maintain a practice of weekly async status updates to ensure clear communication, track progress effectively, and maintain transparency across our team. This process aligns with our core values by fostering collaboration, driving results, and promoting efficiency through structured communication.

### Timing and Frequency

- Team members post updates every Wednesday
- Updates are required for all assigned issues
- Multiple updates may be needed if working on multiple issues

### Template

This is the template to use for the updates

```markdown
## Async Status Update yyyy-mm-dd

- **Progress & Status**: _What progress have you made? What's the current state?_
- **Next Steps**: _What are your planned next actions?_
- **Blockers**: _Are you blocked or need assistance with this?_
- **How confident are you that this will make it to the current milestone?**
    - [ ] Not confident
    - [ ] Slightly confident
    - [ ] Very confident

_Remember to update the workflow label!_

Be sure to tag your engineering manager, product manager, and any team members you are collaborating with.

### Best practices

- Be specific and concise in updates
- Always include next steps, even if they're tentative
- Flag blockers early - don't wait until they become critical
- Use the template consistently for easier scanning
- Link to relevant issues or documentation when appropriate

## Introduction

Welcome to the Code Creation group's working processes guide. This handbook page outlines how our team operates on a day-to-day basis, including our communication channels, issue tracking, development workflows, and milestone planning processes.

We're a globally distributed team working on AI-powered code creation features, and we've developed these practices to ensure clear communication, transparency, and effective collaboration across time zones. These processes help us maintain alignment with our goals while providing the flexibility needed for innovation and problem-solving.

This page serves as both an onboarding resource for new team members and a reference for existing team members to ensure consistency in our workflows. If you have questions about any of these processes, please reach out in our Slack channel (#g_code_creation).

## Engineering Onboarding

To help get started as a developer with the Code Creation team, we have created an
[onboarding issue template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ai-engineering/code-creation/team-tasks/-/issues/new?issuable_template=developer_onboarding).

## Time Off

Team members should add any [planned time off](/handbook/people-group/time-off-and-absence/time-off-types/) in the “Workday” slack app, in accordance with the [taking time off](/handbook/engineering/#taking-time-off) policy, including creating a [PTO coverage issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/engineering-division/pto-coverage/-/issues/new).

## Milestone Planning

See the [Code Creation Milestone Planning](/handbook/engineering/ai/code-creation/how-we-work/milestone_planning/) for more information on the milestone planning process.

## YouTube Playlist

Team meetings and demos are recorded and uploaded to the [Code Creation YouTube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL05JrBw4t0KoZOUC-DfaJOzFb6w6hG198). Some meetings are marked as private, so internal team members will need to switch to use the [Unfiltered YouTube account](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/youtube/#unable-to-view-a-video-on-youtube).

## Weekly Status Updates

See the [Weekly Async Updates](/handbook/engineering/ai/code-creation/how-we-work/async-updates/) page for more information on our practice of posting transparent status updates.

## AI Prompts

We have a collection of prompts we can use with Duo Chat or Duo Agent Platform to help us work more efficiently. You can find them on the [AI Prompts](/handbook/engineering/ai/code-creation/how-we-work/ai-prompts/) page.

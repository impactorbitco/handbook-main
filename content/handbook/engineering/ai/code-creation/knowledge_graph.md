## Overview

The Knowledge Graph project focuses on building semantic understanding of code relationships and dependencies across entire codebases. This enables more intelligent code suggestions and better context awareness for AI-powered development tools.

## Objectives

- Map semantic relationships between code entities (functions, classes, modules)
- Understand code dependencies and usage patterns
- Provide enhanced context for AI-powered features
- Enable intelligent code navigation and discovery

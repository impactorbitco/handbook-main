title: Rotation Leaders
---

Welcome to the Rotation Leader role for the DevOps Tier 2 On-Call program. As a Rotation Leader, you are responsible for the health, fairness, and effectiveness of your team's on-call rotation. This guide outlines your core responsibilities and how to execute them.

## Your Role and Responsibilities

Rotation Leaders are expected to:

- [align according to Infrastructure Platform expectations](/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/incident-management/on-call/#responsibilities-for-rotation-leaders),
- coordinate the DevOps on-call rotation (adding and removing shifts),
- ensure there are enough team members to [provide adequate coverage](/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/incident-management/tier2-escalations/),
- ensure those team members understand their role,
- serve as a point of escalation on the escalation path, and  
- conduct regular reviews on the effectiveness of the rotation

## Managing the Schedule

### Building and Maintaining the Rotation

While [general guidance is provided](/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/incident-management/on-call/#how-many-people-are-needed-to-set-up-a-rotation), you are responsible for the overall structure and composition of the rotation:

- Target 8 people per region (APAC, EMEA, AMER) for balanced workload and flexibility, but minimally 6
- Maximum 12 people before reassessing team structure
- This means engineers will be on call one week for every 6-12 weeks, or between 22-43 days of the year
- Publish schedules at least one month in advance so team members can plan

### The Schedule

**To publish, manage, or view the schedule which includes AMER, EMEA, and APAC DevOps Rotations within it:**

- Use Incident.io as your single source of truth for all scheduling
  - [See all team members on a rotation here](https://app.incident.io/gitlab/catalog/Schedule/01K611MG8T5CW874Q5JZER3H0Z)
  - [Access the on-call schedule here](https://app.incident.io/gitlab/on-call/schedules/01K611MG8T5CW874Q5JZER3H0Z)
  - [See all management included in escalations here](https://app.incident.io/gitlab/catalog/Schedule/01K611ZT9YX2PSA8WAMEP6A66G)
  - [Access the escalation schedule here](https://app.incident.io/gitlab/on-call/schedules/01K611ZT9YX2PSA8WAMEP6A66G)
- Create overrides when someone needs coverage swapped
- Communicate schedule changes promptly to affected team members
- Track future scheduling 3-6 months in advance when possible

### Coverage Hours

[See coverage expectations here.](/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/incident-management/tier2-escalations/#coverage-expectations)

### Public Holidays

[See here.](/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/incident-management/on-call/tier-2/#public-holidays)

## Regular Reviews

Every quarter, conduct a review of:

- [Do we need more Subject Matter Experts?](/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/incident-management/on-call/tier-2/#how-to-determine-if-we-need-a-specific-set-of-subject-matter-experts-to-form-a-tier-2-rotation)
- How many times was each person on-call? Was anyone on-call more than once every 4 weeks? How fairly were shifts distributed?
- How many times are team members paged during a shift?
- Did anyone burn out or report unsustainable load?
- Did you meet your [coverage and response time goals](/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/incident-management/on-call/tier-2/#metrics-that-can-be-reviewed-to-assist-in-this-decision) for each region?
- Are there services generating too few pages (potential coverage gaps) or exessively (alert fatigue)?
- Time to Fix: How long from declaration to resolution?
- Are there patterns around what gets escalated, from who, and why?
- Are escalations going to the right teams on first try (target 90%+)?

## Onboarding New Team Members

### Adding Someone to the Rotation

[See: Getting added to a rotation.](/handbook/engineering/devops/oncall/joining-and-leaving-rotation/#how-do-i-get-added-to-the-rotation)

### Required Onboarding Resources

[Ensure new team members have access to and understand the 1st shift information](/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/incident-management/on-call/tier-2/#resource-locations).

## Iterate

As escalations come in, identify gaps in documentation:

- When Tier 2 engineers escalate, ask what information would have helped them resolve it faster
- Use post-incident retrospectives to identify runbook gaps
- Prioritize creating or updating runbooks for frequent escalation patterns
- Monitor whether incidents reference runbooks
- Identify runbooks that aren't being used and update or remove them
- Create new runbooks based on escalation patterns
- Aim to cover 80% of common incidents

For S1/S2 incidents (or significant S3/S4 incidents):

- Ensure 100% of escalated S1/S2 incidents have a formal retrospective or write-up
- Lead retrospectives in a blameless manner, focusing on system improvements
- Document what was learned and what can be improved
- Track action items and follow up on completion

## Quick Reference: Key Responsibilities

## Team metrics dashboard

We have a [metrics dashboard](https://us-west-2b.online.tableau.com/t/gitlabpublic/views/TopEngineeringMetrics/TopEngineeringMetricsDashboard) intended to
track against some of the [Development Department KPIs](/handbook/company/kpis/#development-department-kpis), particularly
those around merge request creation and acceptance. From that dashboard, the
following chart shows [MR Rate](/handbook/engineering/performance-indicators/#engineering-mr-rate). Please reference the dashboard section below.

## How we work

## Engineering DRI for Large-Scale Initiatives

For substantial epics or projects that require extensive coordination, we designate an Engineering Directly Responsible Individual (DRI). This role is pivotal in managing complex workstreams within our team.

The Engineering <abbr title="Directly Responsible Individual">DRI</abbr> is typically assigned in two scenarios:

1. When an epic reaches the development phase and requires detailed oversight.
1. When an issue grows in scope and complexity, necessitating its promotion to an epic.

Importantly, we appoint the <abbr title="Directly Responsible Individual">DRI</abbr> before breaking down the work into smaller, manageable tasks. This early assignment is crucial because one of the <abbr title="Directly Responsible Individual">DRI</abbr>'s primary responsibilities is to lead the planning process and facilitate the strategic breakdown of the epic or project into actionable deliverables.

By having a dedicated <abbr title="Directly Responsible Individual">DRI</abbr> for these large-scale initiatives, we ensure focused leadership, clear accountability, and effective coordination throughout the development lifecycle of complex engineering efforts.

### Role Responsibilities

*Communicating Progress and Managing Health Status*

The Engineering <abbr title="Directly Responsible Individual">DRI</abbr> oversees weekly updates on the epic, tracking overall health status, including progress, obstacles, and emerging risks.

- They continuously monitor and report on the epic's health status, indicating if it's on track, at risk, or blocked, providing context around any changes.
- Progress updates are reported via a top-level comment on the epic containing the development work (usually linked to our OKRs).
- Updates are due by End of Day on the <abbr title="Directly Responsible Individual">DRI</abbr>'s last workday of the week.

*Facilitating Breakdown of Work*

This role is crucial in breaking down epics into smaller, manageable deliverables, ensuring tasks are clearly defined and ready for development.

*Ensuring Steady Progress*

The responsible individual ensures work items progress smoothly through our Kanban flow, with enough work prepared for development to maintain consistent progress.

*Risk Management and Mitigation*

Early identification of potential risks and proactive collaboration with the team to develop mitigation strategies are key responsibilities. This enhances the role in not only communicating issues but actively managing and resolving them.

*Retrospective and Continuous Improvement*

Upon completion, when an epic exceeds the due date, or when any collaborator requests it, a brief retrospective session should be facilitated to gather feedback on successes and areas for improvement. This practice helps refine processes and improves the handling of future epics.

*Collaboration with Product and Design*

Active collaboration with Product Managers and Designers during the planning phase is essential to ensure the epic's scope aligns with business goals and user experience standards.

*Resource Allocation and Escalation*

The appointed individual is empowered to identify when additional resources or support are needed and to escalate issues promptly. This helps ensure timelines are met and work progresses smoothly.

*Note:* While responsible for timely delivery, the <abbr title="Directly Responsible Individual">DRI</abbr> is not expected to execute every task personally.

### Standardized Status Update Template

To ensure consistency and clarity in our communication, we've implemented a standardized comment template for status updates across the Growth team, facilitated by the triage-ops bot on a specific day each week.
For guidance on using comment templates, please refer to our [Comment Templates Usage Guide](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/description_templates.html#use-the-templates).

## Vision

Grow an agile fullstack development capability to support our product goals through feature development and experiments enabling GitLab to make informed product decisions and achieve results in line with our [product direction](/handbook/marketing/growth/).

For more details on Growth's mission, direction, and product strategy, see the [Growth product handbook](/handbook/marketing/growth/).

## How We Work

Working inline with our [values](/handbook/values/), we focus on [iteration](/handbook/values/#iteration) and [collaboration](/handbook/values/#collaboration), working with and across areas of the product our development department counterparts maintain.

We work on the issues prioritized by our product teams including running [experiments](/handbook/engineering/development/growth/experimentation/) on GitLab.com. Growth stage teams have Fullstack Engineers. The reason for this is that the Growth stage has a need for both Frontend and Backend skill-sets, but as a small team, has optimized for team member efficiency to adopt the Fullstack role.

## Shared Processes

Our teams collaborate using shared processes and tools:

- [Operating Model](operating_model_growth.md) - operating rhythm for growth
- [Initiative Refinement and Estimation](initiative_refinement_estimation) - continuous refinement process and estimation guidelines
- [Engineering DRI for Large-Scale Initiatives](engineering_dri) - managing complex workstreams and epics
- [Technical Exploration Guidelines](technical_spikes) - guidelines for research and spike work
- [Growth Experimentation Guidelines](experimentation) - guidelines for growth experimentations

## Experimentation

Growth teams contribute to GitLab [experimentation](/handbook/engineering/development/growth/experimentation/) to make it easier to run experiments and make data driven product decisions on GitLab.com.

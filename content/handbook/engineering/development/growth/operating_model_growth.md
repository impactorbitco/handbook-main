title: Operating Model for Growth Stage
---

## Operating Rhythm

Growth is driving a pooled staffing model which contains a prioritized list of initiatives focused on impacting Self-Serve (Web Direct) First Orders. Instead of maintaining traditional group boundaries, Product Management, UX, and Engineering resources will be flexibly assigned to top priorities using an agile kanban approach.

## Weekly Cadence

**Wednesday 06:00 UTC**

The triage bot automatically creates status update threads in issues marked with `~"workflow::in dev"`, `~"workflow::in review"`, and `~"workflow::verification"`.

Assignees are expected to provide updates using the bot's comment template and  include demo links if available. All demos should be recorded and uploaded to the [Growth weekly demo playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL05JrBw4t0KrwPNlpnpqeXIlIjOy_ifFl) as unlisted videos for team reference with a prefix of `[Date]: Theme/title`

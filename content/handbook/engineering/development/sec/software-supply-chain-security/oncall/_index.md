title: Software Supply Chain Security Tier 2 On Call
---

Welcome to the Software Supply Chain Security (SSCS) Tier 2 On-Call program! This documentation will guide you through everything you need to know about being on-call for our security platform.

## What is Tier 2 On-Call?

[Tier 2 on-call](/handbook/engineering/development/sec/software-supply-chain-security/oncall/understanding-the-basics) is the second level of incident response here at GitLab. When critical issues affect our services, Tier 2 engineers are the specialists who handle domain-specific problems in Authentication, Authorization, and Pipeline Security that go beyond what our first-line responders (SREs/SIRT) can resolve.

## Getting Started

New to the program? Start [here](/handbook/engineering/development/sec/software-supply-chain-security/oncall/your-first-shift) by learning what Tier 2 on-call means and how it fits into our incident response structure. We'll guide you through everything you need to prepare for your first on-call rotation.

## Program Management

Understanding how the rotation works is essential. Learn how team members are [added, removed, and tracked in the system](/handbook/engineering/development/sec/software-supply-chain-security/oncall/coverage-and-scheduling). We distribute shifts fairly across the team, and you can easily view your schedule. We also have clear processes for managing [PTO, overrides, and public holidays](/handbook/engineering/development/sec/software-supply-chain-security/oncall/time-off-and-holidays) to ensure adequate coverage.

## During Your Shift

When you're actually on-call, you'll need to know what to do when you're paged and how escalation works. Our on-call platform, Incident.io, has specific technical setup requirements and usage guidelines. You'll rely on runbooks and playbooks for documented procedures, and you'll need to [understand how to properly hand off](/handbook/engineering/development/sec/software-supply-chain-security/oncall/handoff-and-continuity) to the next engineer to maintain continuity.

## Tools and Documentation

You'll need access to specific [tools](/handbook/engineering/development/sec/software-supply-chain-security/oncall/tools-and-access) to be effective on-call. Our monitoring and dashboards are essential for investigating issues when they arise. We provide comprehensive onboarding and learning resources to get you up to speed quickly.

## Integration and Coordination

Tier 2 on-call integrates with other on-call rotations including IMOC and other programs. We emphasize [communication and culture](/handbook/engineering/development/sec/software-supply-chain-security/oncall/communication-and-culture) as well as [joining and leaving rotations](/handbook/engineering/development/sec/software-supply-chain-security/oncall/joining-and-leaving-rotation).

## Tracking and Improvement

We track performance metrics to measure [success](/handbook/engineering/development/sec/software-supply-chain-security/oncall/measuring-success) and understand what we're aiming for. We actively seek feedback and suggestions for improvements, and we welcome you to share your experience with the program.

Questions? Ask your [rotation leader](/handbook/engineering/development/sec/software-supply-chain-security/oncall/rotation-leader). We're here to help you succeed!

## Planning Vacation or PTO

### Telling Your Rotation Leader

Well before you take time off:

1. Check the on-call schedule in Incident.io
2. If you're scheduled during that time, tell your rotation leader ASAP. You can do so by reaching out in #sscs-tier2-rotation-coordination to your reporting manager or @adil.farrukh, @ajaythomasinc and @ken.mcdonald as rotation leaders.
3. The rotation leader will either:
   - Find someone to swap with in your region
   - Create an [override](https://help.incident.io/articles/2815264840-cover-me%2C-overrides-and-schedules) (reassign that slot)
   - Adjust the rotation temporarily

**How much advance notice?** Ideally 2-4 weeks, but at least a week for emergencies unless event doesn't allow for advance notice.

### Using Overrides in Incident.io

An **override** is a way to reassign a shift when someone can't make it. If you need assistance finding someone to take over your shift, ask for swaps in #sscs-tier2-rotation-coordination.

**You can:**

- Remove yourself from your shift
- Assign it to someone else in your region

## Public Holidays

Please refer to the general on-call documentation regarding [holidays](/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/incident-management/on-call/holiday-coverage-planning/).

### Regional Considerations

Since the SSCS rotation covers three regions (APAC, EMEA, AMER), public holidays vary significantly:

- **APAC engineers** may have holidays that EMEA/AMER don't observe
- **EMEA engineers** may have holidays that APAC/AMER don't observe
- **AMER engineers** may have holidays that APAC/EMEA don't observe

**Your responsibility:** Check your schedule well in advance and notify your rotation leader if you're scheduled during a public holiday in your country.

### Finding Coverage for Holidays

When you have a public holiday:

1. **Check your schedule** in Incident.io
2. **Notify your rotation leader** as soon as possible
3. **Find a swap** with someone in your region who doesn't observe that holiday
4. **Create an override** in Incident.io or ask your rotation leader to do so

**Exception for Netherlands:** Team members in the Netherlands must notify the rotation leader with at least 2 working days notice, and the rotation leader (not the team member) is responsible for finding cover, as agreed with the Works Council.

## What Happens If You're Assigned During PTO?

This is a mistake. Here's what to do:

1. **Don't just miss it.** Tell someone immediately.
2. Contact your rotation leader or manager
3. They'll create an override ASAP

## Cross-Region Coverage

In some cases, if your region is short-staffed during holidays:

- Your rotation leader may ask for volunteers from other regions
- This is optional and should be compensated appropriately
- Coverage should still align with the volunteer's work hours when possible

## Planning Ahead

To make holiday coverage easier:

- **Share your holiday calendar** with your team at the start of the year
- **Coordinate with teammates** in your region to ensure coverage
- **Be flexible** when possible to help teammates who need coverage
- **Plan swaps early** rather than waiting until the last minute

## Project management process

The Seat Management project management process inherits from the general Fulfillment [project management process](/handbook/engineering/development/fulfillment/#project-management-process) and adds a few additional elements specific to the work that the Seat Management team does.

### Planning

The milestone planning process is built around [planning issues](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/fulfillment/meta/-/issues/?sort=milestone_due_desc&state=opened&label_name%5B%5D=Planning%20Issue&label_name%5B%5D=group%3A%3Aseat%20management&first_page_size=100) for the milestone, these issue outlines what issues will be worked on in the upcoming milestone, how those issues are prioritized, commentary on how that fits with over arching goals, and how the proposed work fits in the capacity for the next month.

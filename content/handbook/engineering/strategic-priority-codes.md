## Strategic Priority Codes - Prioritization System

The Priority Code system provides a sophisticated approach to strategic resource allocation and innovation acceleration. Rather than reactive crisis management, these codes enable proactive competitive positioning and breakthrough achievement.

The three colors:

- **Code Red**: Mission-critical incidents (max 3 months, 24/7 staffing, complete resource mobilization)
- **Code Yellow**: High-impact critical initiatives (max 6 months, focused cross-team collaboration)
- **Code Purple**: Strategic technology advancement (max 18 months, targeted specialized teams)

### Threshold for Priority Codes

A project requires a Strategic Priority Code when it demands large cross-functional investment, spans inter and cross-department or division collaboration, or when the situation is impeding or putting other business priorities at risk.

### Examples

- **Code Yellow**: Protocells - a systematic improvement requiring cross-team collaboration on complex technical challenges
- **Code Purple**: Auth system redesign - a strategic technology advancement initiative requiring coordinated effort over extended timeframes

## Approval Process

### Who Can Declare Priority Codes

- Only department leaders within R&D have the authority to propose a color code
- Department leaders must collaborate with their department peers before requesting a code color be called. Collaboration includes peers of dependency groups and groups that will be impacted by the code
- The CTO (Division Leader) has the final authority to declare a code if the impacted and dependency groups all reside within Engineering. For programs of broader reach, the peer Division Leader(s) in e-group must also approve before the code can be declared

### Accountability

- The department leader who declared the color code (or their designated delegate) is accountable for the execution of the project
- This includes ensuring deliverables, timelines, all internal communication to the appropriate leadership forums with regular progress updates as well as when the success criteria are met

## Concurrent Projects and Priority Management

### Project Limits

- **Code Red**: Maximum of 1 active project at any time due to complete resource mobilization requirements
- **Code Yellow**: Maximum of 2 active projects simultaneously, depending on scope and resource requirements
- **Code Purple**: Multiple projects can run concurrently as they use targeted teams with specialized expertise

### Priority Hierarchy

When multiple codes are active, the following priority order applies:

1. **Code Red** takes absolute priority - all other work may be paused or deprioritized
2. **Code Yellow** takes priority over regular roadmap work and Code Purple projects
3. **Code Purple** projects continue unless resources are needed for higher-priority codes

### Resource Allocation Rules

- Code Red projects can pull resources from any other initiative, including active Code Yellow and Purple projects
- Code Yellow projects can reallocate team members from regular roadmap work and Code Purple projects
- Code Purple projects operate within their designated resource allocation and cannot pull from other strategic initiatives

### Conflict Resolution

- The CTO and their eGroup peers will consider existing active codes when approving new ones
- If resource conflicts arise, the declaring department leader must work with affected teams to resolve capacity issues
- Escalation to CTO is required if conflicts cannot be resolved at the department level

## Code Red: Mission-Critical Initiatives

### Definition

Code Red signifies the highest-priority classification to address high-severity incidents or existential business threats to the company. This includes widespread outages, major service degradations, impacts to significant portions of users or core infrastructure, critical security breaches, regulatory compliance failures, or strategic threats that could fundamentally disrupt business continuity, market position, or company viability. Code Red may also indicate an immediate and severe threat to service availability, data integrity, security, or core business operations.

### Strategic Purpose

The primary goal of Code Red is to rapidly restore service stability, mitigate immediate damage, neutralize existential threats, and prevent recurrence or escalation. Its purpose is to trigger an immediate, all-hands-on-deck response from relevant engineering, product, security, operations, legal, and executive teams to address the crisis with absolute highest priority, ensuring business continuity and stakeholder confidence. All work not designated Code Red is subject to impacts/pauses to accommodate critical execution activities.

### Mechanism

- Code Red is declared by a member of eGroup with a defined problem statement, scope, and assigned DRIs/leads
- Complete availability of engineering and product resources
- eGroup level direct involvement and daily oversight
- Dedicated communication channels for real-time updates and collaboration
- Control Center establishment for accelerated decision making
- Cross-functional crisis response team activation (engineering, legal, communications, security)
- External stakeholder communication protocols as needed
- Clear definition of metrics and exit criteria

### Timeline

Short and focused. Should not last more than 1 month and requires 24/7 attention and whatever it takes to get it closed. Should never go over 3 months.

## Code Yellow: High-Impact Critical Initiatives

### Definition

Code Yellow signifies a high-priority classification for systematic improvements and strategic initiatives that address significant technical debt, enable cross-team collaboration on complex challenges, or drive innovation through concentrated engineering effort. It indicates substantial business impact requiring focused attention and resource allocation without full organizational mobilization.

### Strategic Purpose

The primary goal of Code Yellow is to drive systematic improvements across product portfolios, address technical debt that impacts user experience or business scalability, enable focused cross-team collaboration on complex technical challenges, and accelerate innovation through concentrated engineering effort. Its purpose is to bring focused attention and resources to high-stakes projects that demand careful management to avoid future critical impact.

Code Yellow projects take priority over other work and can be used to drive fast re-prioritization and allow reallocation of team members even from the highest priorities on the roadmap (e.g., P1s/E1/T1).

### Execution Framework

- Code Yellow is declared by the CTO (and any impacted e-group leaders joint) with direct accountability on the leading Engineering Division department leader
- Strategic leader receives authority to reallocate team members across teams
- Cross-divisional collaboration regardless of existing commitments
- Division level involvement and weekly oversight
- Clear communication channels and escalation paths for streamlined communication and collaboration
- May result in temporary suspension of routine projects for participating teams
- Escalation pathways to higher-priority classifications if needed
- Clear definition of exit criteria (measurable improvement targets)

### Timeline

Medium-term focus: 3-6 months

## Code Purple: High-Impact Strategic Initiative

### Definition

Code Purple signifies a strategic classification for targeted technology advancement and product innovation initiatives that require coordinated effort over extended timeframes but not full organizational mobilization. It addresses focused market opportunities, competitive gaps, and breakthrough innovation in emerging technology areas.

### Strategic Purpose

The primary goal of Code Purple is to advance specific technology capabilities or product features, address competitive gaps in focused market segments, enable breakthrough innovation in emerging technology areas, and optimize business processes and operational efficiency. Its purpose is to drive strategic advancement through specialized expertise and structured innovation methodology.

### Execution Framework

- Code Purple is declared by an Engineering Division department leader with CTO (and any impacted e-group leaders joint) approval
- Targeted team formation with specialized expertise
- Structured innovation methodology with defined milestones
- Cross-functional collaboration within defined scope
- Regular progress reviews on a monthly or semi-quarterly basis
- Escalation pathways to higher-priority classifications if needed
- Clear success metrics
- Resource allocation based on strategic priority and market opportunity
- Clear definition of metrics and exit criteria

### Timeline

Long-term strategic focus: 6-12 months. Can go up to 18 months in rare situations.

## Chris Kaburu's README

Welcome! Here's a glimpse into who I am and how I work. If you’d like to chat, have a question, a bright idea, or just fancy a chinwag, don’t hesitate to ping me. I’m always happy to share stories and connect.

## A Little About Me 🌆

I’m Chris, originally from Nairobi, Kenya (a city so wild it has a national park in it). Growing up surrounded by Nairobi’s vibrant culture and natural beauty, I developed a deep love for exploration, lifelong learning, and celebrating diversity. These passions eventually led me on an adventurous path to the Netherlands.

To me, life is about appreciating small joys and weaving them into how I live, work, and engage with others.

## My Professional Journey  💼

I embarked on my GitLab journey in September 2022 as a Support Engineer. Over time I realized that support is not only about problem-solving, but also about empathy, effective communication, and going the extra mile to make someone else's day better, traits that have been consistent across my diverse experiences prior to this.

While I continue to enjoy exploring different technical domains, my experience now spans Kubernetes, failover systems, cluster management, and performance in distributed systems. I focus on deepening this expertise while staying curious and open to learning in adjacent areas. I'm also committed to sharing what I’ve learned, whether through collaboration, documentation, or mentorship, as these technologies evolve.

### My Assumptions 🌱

What drew me to GitLab was its strong [value system](/handbook/values/), and being here has only reinforced that. I live by these values daily and hold the following assumptions about those I work with:

- You [mean well](/handbook/values/#assume-positive-intent)
- You'll [fulfill your commitments](/handbook/values/#have-ownership--accountability).
- You're [direct](/handbook/values/#directness).

If I ever fall short of these, please hold me accountable, I’ll do the same for you, with respect and openness.

## How I Work ⏰

I typically work from 6:00 AM to 3:00 PM CEST, which aligns with when I’m most productive and responsive. After 3 PM, I check Slack less frequently and primarily respond to direct mentions. My schedule may occasionally shift based on project needs.

## Availability and Communication Preferences 📞

I believe in clear, respectful, and direct communication. Most problems can be solved or better understood through open conversation.

If you need support, want to explore an idea, or just have something on your mind, feel free to reach out. I’ll do my best to help directly or connect you with someone who can.

And yes; I'm always up for a coffee chat! Few things beat a good brew and a great conversation, whether we’re exchanging ideas or just catching up casually.

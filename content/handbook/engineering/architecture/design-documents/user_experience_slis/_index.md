## Glossary

- **SLI**: [Service Level Indicator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_level_indicator) is a measure of the service level provided by a service provider to a customer.
- **Application SLI**: This is an SLI defined on the application side: the application decides what is “good” for apdex and error portion. The SLI is associated with a service for monitoring in the runbooks repository. https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/application_slis/
- **Apdex (Application Performance Index)**: At GitLab in the context of User Experience SLIs, it is the completion of something within an acceptable amount of time, for example, the changes of a push are visible on the merge request within 30 seconds.
- **User Journey**: A comprehensive visualization or map that illustrates all the checkpoints, interactions, and emotions a customer experiences when engaging with a product, service, or brand, from initial awareness through purchase and beyond. In GitLab, it is the journey a user takes through the application. This can include multiple experiences. For example: Create a project -> Create an issue -> Create a merge request.
- **Covered Experience**: A part of User Experience that is covered by our SLA. Currently not all Covered Experiences are defined as a User Experience SLI. We should aim to improve this.
- **User Experience SLI**: An SLI implementation that represents an end-to-end flow of user interactions that may span multiple services.
- **Multi-action Experience**: A user journey that consists of multiple user interactions before completion, for example creating an issue consisting of 2 checkpoints: render new, submit form. We will not support this in the first iteration of User Experience SLIs.
- **Single-action Experience**: A user journey that consists of a single user interaction, for example “view an issue” or “add a comment to an issue”.
- **Multi-service Experience**: A journey that depends on multiple services to successfully complete, for example: a push gets received by GitLab-shell, which calls out to Rails, Gitaly and Sidekiq. A multi-service experience could be a single-action experience, only a single user-action is required for the experience, but it spans multiple services to be completed.
- **Criteria**: Each Experience can have one or more criteria that can be used to measure success. For example: “The issue is successfully created” AND “The issue is created fast enough”.
- **User Experience Definition**: The specification of the User Experience, distinguished by its `user_experience_id`. Example: user_experience_id="create_merge_request".
- **User Experience Event**: One instance of a User Experience. Distinguished by the properties `user_experience_id` and `correlation_id`. Example:
user_experience_id="create_merge_request" & correlation_id="01G65Z755AFWAKHE12NY0CQ9FH".
- **User Experience Checkpoint**: This is the moment in the experience that we emit one event: the start of a request, the start of a job, the end of a request, the end of a job, etc.
We'll have at least one of these within a User Experience Event, but there can be multiple.

## Motivation

While GitLab has robust service-level metrics through our SLI framework, we currently lack a systematic way to track and measure User Experiences that span multiple services. Our existing SLIs excel at measuring individual service performance but cannot effectively track the success/failure rate and performance of end-to-end user interactions. This gap makes it challenging to:

- Understand the true user experience across service boundaries
- Set and monitor user-centric SLOs for complex user interactions
- Identify bottlenecks in multi-service flows
- Measure reliability and impact of incidents for customers and users

## Goal

Track and measure User Experiences across GitLab services, establishing a framework for product teams to define and monitor User Experience SLIs.

### User Experience SLIs vs Covered Experiences

While both concepts relate to measuring user-facing functionality, they serve different purposes:

- **Covered Experiences** represent parts of the user experience that are covered by our SLA commitments, but may not have specific SLI implementations yet.
- **User Experience SLIs** are the technical implementation of measurable, instrumented experiences with defined success criteria and monitoring.

Our goal is to bridge this gap by implementing User Experience SLIs for all Covered Experiences over time.
This would be one way we get early notifications on problems with Covered Experiences, before we breach SLA for a customer.

### How do User Experiences relate to User Journeys?

User Experiences are small interactions that users do on the platform. User Experiences focus specifically on single-actions users do that can be tracked and monitored through SLIs. While User Journeys represent comprehensive end-to-end paths a user might within the application. A User Journey can consist of many User Experiences, and a single User Experience can be part of many User Journeys.

```mermaid
erDiagram
    user_experience ||--o{ user_experience_event : "has many instances of"
    user_experience }o--o{ user_journey : "belongs to"
    user_journey ||--o{ user_journey_event : "has many instances of"
    user_experience_event ||--o{ user_journey_event : "has many instances of"
```

Key relationships between the two concepts:

- **Scope**: A User Journey might encompass multiple User Experiences. For example, the User Journey of "contributing code to a project" might include several User Experiences like "git push," "merge request creation," and "CI pipeline execution".
- **Measurability**: User Experiences are specifically designed to be measurable through our SLI framework, with clear success criteria and thresholds. They should not include ambiguity through decisions that a user makes throughout their Journey.
- **Implementation**: User Journeys are often conceptual and used for product planning. User Experiences have specific technical implementations with instrumentation, metrics, and alerting.

Product defines the User Journeys and works together with Engineering to specify which User Experiences are part of those journeys. Here's a graphical representation:

[graph src](https://lucid.app/lucidchart/e911c437-dbdf-4540-bf44-23962e048661/edit)

## Dos

- Create a framework for product teams to define important User Experience SLIs in a structured way
- Develop an SDK that makes it easy for engineers to instrument User Experiences
- Support both GitLab.com and Dedicated deployments
- Enable measurement of User Experience success/failure rates and durations through metrics and logs
- Inform on the performance of User Experiences through SLIs that allow alerting on specified thresholds through our existing alerting framework

## Don'ts

- Building a general-purpose distributed tracing solution
- Tracking client side timings, and time on the wire to clients. In the future, we want to add support for clients we build (IDE-extensions, our frontend), but we're keeping this out of scope in the first iteration.
- Real-time User Experience visualization or debugging tools
- Logs and metrics will be emitted from self-managed, but it won't officially support ingesting information from those instances as we don't have control over such environments

## Unscoped

1. Other projects could benefit from User Experience SLIs, but are not part of the scope of this proposal. Such as:
    - Ensure critical user paths are well-tested and monitored (i.e. https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/quality/-/epics/144).
    The User Experience SLIs could provide data that can help identify end-to-end test coverage gaps for critical user paths.
    - Use User Experiences to inform Service Level Agreements (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/mstaff/-/issues/423)
2. Implementing a User Experience Tracker. There's a [proposal](next_step.md) for implementing a new service, as the likely
next step (covered in [epic #1540](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/gl-infra/-/epics/1540)), however, it is prone to change
as we progress on the implementation of User Experiences SDK, and discover its nuances and leverage points.

## Scope

The implementation consists of the following components:

1. [User Experience Definition Framework](#user-experience-sli-definition)
2. [LabKit SDK](#sdk-requirements)

The project work items are scoped in the [epic #1539](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/gl-infra/-/epics/1539).

The [User Experience Definition](#user-experience-sli-definition) will provide an specification for each User Experience SLI,
and the [SDK](#sdk-requirements) will be used to instrument the services to emit events (metrics and logs).

Example:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Web as Web Service
    participant Worker
    participant Event as Logs and Metrics

    User->>Web: Request
    activate Web

    Web->>Event: Checkpoint 1, SDK Emit Start
    Web->>Worker: Enqueue Job
    %% enqueued job will have all the User Experience relevant context,
    %% such as `correlation_id`, for example
    Note over Web,Worker: Including event metadata
    Web-->>User: Response
    deactivate Web

    Note over Worker: Job wait in queue

    Note over Worker: Job starts
    activate Worker

    alt Success Case
        Worker->>Worker: End User Experience
        Worker->>Event: Checkpoint 2, SDK Emit Success
    else Failure Case
        Worker->>Worker: End User Experience
        Worker->>Event: Checkpoint 2, SDK Emit Failure
    end

    deactivate Worker

```

### User Experience SLI Definition

- YAML-based User Experience SLI definition authored by product teams
- Support for specifying success criteria

The User Experience definition will contain the following fields:

| Field              | Type   | Required | Description                                                                                                   | Example                        |
|--------------------|--------|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| user_experience_id | string | Yes      | User Experience identifier                                                                                    | "merge_request_creation"       |
| description        | string | Yes      | Human readable description                                                                                    | "User creates a merge request" |
| feature_category   | string | Yes      | [GitLab feature category](https://docs.gitlab.com/development/feature_categorization/#feature-categorization) | "source_code_management"       |
| urgency            | string | Yes      | How quickly a process needs to complete based on user expectations                                            | "sync_fast"                    |

Non-exhaustive list of urgencies to be supported:

| Threshold    | Description                                                                                                                                                      | Examples                                                                       | Value |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|
| `sync_fast`  | A user is awaiting a synchronous response which needs to be returned before they can continue with their action                                                  | A full-page render                                                             | 2s    |
| `sync_slow`  | A user is awaiting a synchronous response which needs to be returned before they can continue with their action, but which the user may accept a slower response | Displaying a full-text search response while displaying an amusement animation | 5s    |
| `async_fast` | An async process which may block a user from continuing with their user journey                                                                                  | MR diff update after git push                                                  | 15s   |
| `async_slow` | An async process which will not block a user and will not be immediately noticed as being slow                                                                   | Notification following an assignment                                           | 5m    |

As product teams implement more User Experience SLIs, the list of urgencies will grow to accomodate different scenarios.

Examples:

| user_experience_id     | description                  | feature_category       | urgency     |
|------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------|-------------|
| merge_request_creation | User creates a merge request | source_code_management | "sync_fast" |
| git_push               | User pushes commits to a repository | source_code_management | "async_fast" |

Given that Application SLIs are implemented in the [Rails monolith](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab) at the moment, it will also function as a
[registry](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/observability/team/-/issues/4099) initially to store the definitions for the User Experience SLIs.

### SDK Requirements

- Implementation in [LabKit](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ruby/gems/labkit-ruby)
- DSL for sending User Experience events and checkpoints

The SDK will emit 1 event in every checkpoint (each interaction along the entire flow):

And 2 more events, emitted at the end of the flow, to signify error and success:

   Cons:
   - Continue lacking end-to-end user experience visibility and measurement
   - Harder to set meaningful SLOs
   - Miss opportunities for better capturing perceived user experience and testing coverage

## History

User Experience SLIs were formely named Covered Experience SLIs. It has been [renamed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/observability/team/-/issues/4347) to avoid clashing with industry SLA terminology, also used in our [Service Level Agreement](/handbook/engineering/infrastructure-platforms/service-level-agreement/).

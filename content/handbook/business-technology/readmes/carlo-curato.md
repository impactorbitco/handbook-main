### About me

I am an IT Professional with over 2 decades of experience, 16 years of which was in a leadership role and I have been as passionate and energetic about this field since day 1!

As a Leader, I have two main goals. First, to focus on helping my team be the best possible version of themselves through training, coaching or even just unblocking hurdles where I can. Second is to be hands-on. To know and understand what is going on in the organization I am leading and provide relevant strategies and goals.

As an IT Professional, what I enjoy most is navigating through various challenges and using technology to solve them. The constant change in available technology is what keeps me on my toes and keeps me forward looking.

### My Work Philosophy

#### Beliefs

- Each person has their unique story and if understood, can contribute heavily to the same mission.
- Making the environment fun removes the chore from the work.
- Honest and Respectful conversations clear the air.
- Everyone is encouraged to take risks, be decisive and give their opinion.
- Being at work, we need to understand that there is a mission. There's a reason why we are here and in our roles.
- Technology can take you far but its in the team that runs it where transformation happens.

#### Method

- We answer to the Mission, I expect us to collaborate and be decisive in support of our mission.
- With respect and understanding of each idea and capability.
- With tenacity in challenging each other and at times, agreeing to disagree, but align on serving the mission.
- Borrow from the best, don't recreate the wheel.
- Listen to feedback, its a gift.

#### Execution

Carry out our duties to the best of our abilities by:

- Saying what we will do and doing what we say. (Gain Credibility)
- Follow up to ensure we delivered to expectations. (Close the Loop)
- Present solutions rather than excuses. (Provide resolution)

#### Values

- Tell the truth.
- Be respectful.
- Put in an honest day's effort.
- Carry our fair share.
- Be credible

### Outside of work

I love spending time with my small family. I have a wife and a daughter and we enjoy exploring the outdoors (hiking, paddle boarding) as well as spending our weekends exploring new places. I personally love photography and enjoy exploring food all around and these are best enjoyed with family and friends.

#### Acknowledgement

I have been fortunate to be mentored by good leaders and my readme is mostly borrowed from those I have worked with.

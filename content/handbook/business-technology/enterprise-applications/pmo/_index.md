## IT EntApps Portfolio Planning & Prioritization: A 5-Step Framework

![it-pmo](/images/business-technology/enterprise-applications/pmo/it-pmo-planning.png)

The IT EntApps Portfolio planning & prioritization process has 5 steps:

1. Portfolio of Projects
2. Prioritization
3. T-Shirt Sizing
4. Resources & Capacity Planning
5. Project Commits

### Portfolio of Projects

This section provides an inventory of all the committed and planned projects for IT Enterprise Applications. Internal team members can use the [IT EntApps Portfolio tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ojnTFGB2iYJz9kNPYdoLc4PeyDqAN60gu9cQBrKpHJQ/edit?pli=1#gid=1316376797) to track in-flight initiatives. EntApps portfolio priorities must align with the company objectives.

### Project Prioritization

The [IT EntApps Project Prioritization tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fnV3nWI0sNdbakHUys78d-lpbpKexFD_1kdO8JoVySY/edit#gid=745075679) serves as a centralized tool to log and manage new projects and initiatives. The PMO team evaluates these entries during the EntApps Monthly Business Review sessions.

### T-Shirt Sizing

Involves identifying the project's:

- Estimated Level Of Effort (LOE)
- Duration
- Roles & Responsibilities

### Resources & Capacity Planning

Achieved by:

- Identifying all resource within the team
- Estimating the capacity requirements for activities such as "Keeping the Lights On" (KTLO), administrative tasks, management, and project work.

### Project Commits

All projects added to the [IT EntApps Portfolio tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ojnTFGB2iYJz9kNPYdoLc4PeyDqAN60gu9cQBrKpHJQ/edit?pli=1#gid=955721517) are assigned resources based on priority and categorized under the following labels:

- **Committed**: Projects that are in-flight / being worked on.
- **Planned**: Projects that will be picked up once the resources from a committed project becomes available.

## Release Management

The release management plan helps the IT EntApps team to:

- Establish a standardized process.
- Implement the release management strategy.
- Maintain consistency and predictability in releases.
- Communicate changes regularly and transparently.

### Release Calendar

## Governance and Program Management Methodology

Visit the [Governance and IT Program Management](/handbook/business-technology/enterprise-applications/pmo/pmo-governance/) page to understand the methodology adopted by the IT EntApps PMO team for all GitLab EntApps programs aimed at achieving the following objectives:

- Ensure robust results and efficient execution.
- Scope projects effectively, aligning with iterative values.
- Engage relevant stakeholders to foster collaboration.
- Maintain transparent and compliant documentation practices.

## Project Epics & Issues

When assigned to a project, the IT EntApps PMO team is responsible for creating and maintaining the project [Epic](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/epics/index.html). A single parent Epic is created together with (up to) 5 [child Epics](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/epics/manage_epics.html#multi-level-child-epics), each representing a distinct phase of the System Development Lifecycle (SDLC). [Issues](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issues/) are used as a means to collaborate on ideas, troubleshoot problems, and strategize for their tasks. By using issues, teams can share and discuss proposals internally or involve external collaborators in the process.

To maintain uniformity across all PMO-led projects, the team follows the same [Epic templates](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/intake/-/issues/394).

### System Development Lifecycle (SDLC)

The System Development Lifecycle outlines a structured set of activities conducted at each project stage.

![it-pmo](/images/business-technology/enterprise-applications/pmo/sdlc.png)

#### Intake

The Intake process begins with the completion of a business requirements document (BRD). This phase bridges the gap between business stakeholders defining project goals and the development team responsible for implementation.

#### Define

The Define phase focuses on articulating the business problem and establishing the `definition of done`. It includes identifying use cases, affected technologies, and requirements. The primary goal is to document processes and impacted areas rather than resolve every detail. Before moving to the Design phase, approval is obtained from key stakeholders to ensure accuracy and completeness of business requirements.

#### Design

The Design phase establishes a roadmap for the future state of the project. The project team collaborates with stakeholders to refine requirements and design processes that align with business goals. This phase addresses outstanding details and resolves any questions from earlier stages.

#### Build

During the Build phase, the project team collaborates with stakeholders to develop scalable solutions that meet business requirements while adhering to best practices.

#### Test

In the Test phase, the project team works with stakeholders to create test scripts and oversee the User Acceptance Testing (UAT) process, ensuring solutions meet the defined requirements.

#### Deploy

The Deploy phase involves creating a comprehensive deployment plan in collaboration with implementation teams. Activities include finalizing launch plans, enabling users, and managing go-live communications to ensure a smooth transition.

#### Hypercare

Hypercare is the phase immediately following the deployment or launch of a new process in production. During this period, enhanced support is provided to ensure a seamless transition and successful adoption of the new system.

#### Maintenance

The Maintenance phase begins after the new process becomes fully operational. It ensures the process continues to function as designed, with repairs or upgrades performed as necessary.

### Issue Boards

IT EntApps teams use GitLab [issue boards](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issue_board.html) to strategically plan, organize, and visualize their work. To learn more about how IT EntApps teams manage issue boards, refer to [each team’s respective page](/handbook/business-technology/#i-classfas-fa-users-idbiz-tech-iconsi-our-functional-structure).

### Labels

The IT EntApps teams use [labels](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/labels.html) to efficiently categorize issues and epics. A well-maintained, concise label list facilitates dynamic filtering and streamlined management of work. All labels are created within the `gitlab.com/gitlab-com` top-level group, making them applicable across all projects.

To better organize and manage their work, the IT teams have different label categories. Click on each category to view the current labels utilized by the IT teams:

- [Priority labels](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/-/labels?subscribed=&sort=relevance&search=entapps-priority)
- [Team labels](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/-/labels?subscribed=&sort=relevance&search=entapps-teams)

- [Service Desk labels](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/-/labels?subscribed=&sort=relevance&search=entapps-type)

This section is provided to help guide you through the Knowledge article review process

An Article Review is where we review knowledge articles for accuracy, relevancy and usage.  The Review process typically involves a workflow to make sure everyone stays involved.

**Knowledge Champions** will be assisting with reviews, however, all knowledge authors and contributors can assist. We ALL own the knowledge baase, so its up to ALL of us to ensure content is up to date. If you author an article,  review it. (and that will be part of our review cycle).

## How will it work?

- Each Month a report will be run of all articles
- Subject matter Experts (SMEs) will be asked to review any number of articles for their respective areas.
- Knowledge Champions will be asked to work with the SMEs to help facilitate the reviews.

The Review will check for:

- Formatting (is it accurate, consisent with the template)
- Accurate information that is up to date
- Is the article complete and provide clarity (Can a customer read it and understand it)
- Is the article being used (viewed)
- Is the article linked to support tickets for resolution

**Note**: More information will be provided as we work with Knowledge Champions to outline this process.  

**Questions** can be asked in the dedicated [#spt_knowledge-base](https://gitlab.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C07QDCG4AGH) Slack channel.

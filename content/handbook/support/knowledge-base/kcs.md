This information will help you understand KCS and its benefits to GitLab.

**What is KCS**

- KCS is a methodology that transforms how organizations capture, create and leverage Knowledge
- KCS is a methodology used by customer support teams to improve efficiency, consistency, and quality in handling customer inquiries.
- KCS focuses on creating and maintaining a knowledge base to support both customers and support agents
- KCS Is a framework that integrates knowledge creation and management directly into the workflow (Service and Support).
- KCS Is a proactive approach. Knowledge is an asset that can be continuously updated and shared.

**Why are we so focused on KCS and Knowledge management?**

KCS and Knowledge arent just about efficiency (although its important!) it's about creating connections between GitLab and our Customers!  We will show the story of why it's important through metrics, but we also want to see real world examples of how it can impact us here at Gitlab! Here's an example :

- **Before KCS**
    Customer submits an urgent ticket at 2am. The Support engineer spends 45 minutes researching the issue (from older issues, from documentation resources, handbook), they ask messages in slack (but maybe an expert isn't in the same timezone and is sound asleep) Multiple hours can go by waiting for help and frustration builds.

- **After KCS**
    The customer submits an urgent ticket. The Support Engineer searches for knowledge and immediately finds a relevant knowledge article.  Resolution happens within 10 minutes.  The customer receives help, the knowledge article and the issue is resolved quickly. The Support Engineer can move on to the next issue!

Our Goal is to not only create efficiencies with knowledge and KCS but to help our Customers, help our internal support team members!

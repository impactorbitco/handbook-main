### Internal Knowledge Articles

We have internal knowledge articles that will be surfaced to our internal GitLab Employees only.

With KCS, the standard for knowledge articles is 80% external customer facing articles with 20% internal.

Articles that are internal can be focused on processes, workflows, Playbooks, best practices, etc. These are articles that could also be searched from within Support ticket searches.

**Examples of Internal articles:**

- Processes
- Onboarding details
- Policy and Procedures
- Internal decisions, awareness
- Any details that should not be sent out to a customer, but should be captured can be internal knowledge

### Notes

- Today, all GitLab employees can go to the [support portal](https://support.gitlab.com) knowledge base and see ALL articles regardless of being internal or external.
- A knowledge article that is INTERNAL ONLY will show a Lock icon.
- If an article is searched from a support ticket it will also show a LOCK Icon indicating that it is an internal only article. These should NOT be sent to a customer.

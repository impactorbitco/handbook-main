title: Knowledge Base Workflow
description: This section is designed to help you understand the Knowledge Article Workflow
---

The Knowledge Workflow is the process of how information flows from creation to publication. We capture knowledge, create it, then have it reviewed, organized, categorized, and published. The goal is to create a smooth, efficient flow where valuable knowledge is used by all and not lost (or trapped in someone's head). Having the Knowledge workflow helps us manage the Knowledge process easily and efficiently.

## Create a Knowledge article

Before creating a new article, search the existing knowledge articles to make sure one does not already exist for the issue.

- Draft article is created (using a template)
- Knowledge Article is `In Progress`
- The Knowledge Team then reviews the article for accuracy. (Is the formatting correct, are there any spelling errors, do the links work?)
- The article is then ready to be "Reviewed" by a "Technical Reviewer". (assign the article to a technical reviewer and move to `Awaiting Review`)
- The article is `Published`

- When creating the knowledge article it should always be in `In Progress` status.
- `Awaiting Review` status will be used when assigning to a Technical Reviewer.
- `Ready to Publish` status will be used for articles that are reviewed and ready to be published on a specific date (Example: articles set for product releases)

## Modify a Knowledge article

- Article is in **Edit** status (draft).
- Knowledge Article is `in Progress`.
- Save the article.
- The article is then ready to be "Reviewed" by a "Technical Reviewer" (only if major changes. Minor changes it can be Republished).
- The article is `Published`.

When modifying a knowledge article, the article goes back to `Draft`. The current version of the article will remain active on the page. When the draft is published with updates, it will update the page.

## Approving and Publishing a Knowledge article

- Article is `Awaiting Review` or `Ready to Publish` status.
- Technical review must be done on the article.
- If changes need to be made, use the **Assign to** (Round Circle icon near the title). Add comments and assign to the author to make changes.
- Save the article.
- Ensure the visibility of the article is correct.
  - `Agent and Admins` means it is a private article, visible only to internal team members.
  - `Everyone` means it is public.
- If the article is ready to publish, choose the **Publish** button. (Use the down arrow next to the Save button)
- The article is `Published`.

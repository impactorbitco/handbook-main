## Overview

Switchboard is a portal customers use to manage their GitLab Dedicated instance. Select GitLab team members have access to Switchboard.
Read more about what the goals of Switchboard are on the [Category Direction page](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/platforms/switchboard/).

## Accessing Switchboard

GitLab Support Engineers can access the [Switchboard](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/platforms/switchboard/) application by searching for **Switchboard (production)** in the [Okta](/handbook/security/corporate/end-user-services/okta/) homepage.

You can also access directly:

1. Navigate to https://console.gitlab-dedicated.com
1. Enter your GitLab email and click **Continue**
1. You should be signed in to Switchboard through Okta

During [onboarding](https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/dedicated/#onboarding-to-gitlab-dedicated-using-switchboard), GitLab Dedicated customers get access to Switchboard. Temporary credentials are sent to these customers through email. If these credentials expire, customers may open a Support ticket. Support Engineers should open a [request for help](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/request-for-help/-/issues/new?issuable_template=SupportRequestTemplate-Switchboard) with Switchboard.

### Customers with Dedicated Preprod deployments

GitLab Support Engineers can access [Switchboard for Preprod](https://console.gitlab-dedicated.systems/) deployments. Look for the **Switchboard Preprod Dedicated** tile in Okta.

### Password reset

External Switchboard users can reset their password independently using the Switchboard application.

### Multi-factor authentication (MFA) reset

Switchboard users cannot reset their MFA themselves.

To reset MFA, create a [request for help issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/request-for-help/-/issues/new?issuable_template=SupportRequestTemplate-Switchboard) for the Switchboard team.

## Accessing customer configuration

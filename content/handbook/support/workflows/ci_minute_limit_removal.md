## Summary

Sometimes groups owned by GitLab or GitLab employees might need the CI pipeline minutes limit removed, be it for operational reasons or some other reason.
If the request is urgent you can also notify the people of [#support_team-chat](https://gitlab.enterprise.slack.com/archives/CCBJYEWAW) with the issue link
and by mentioning the current on call manager (`@support-manager-oncall` in slack).

### Requesting limit to be removed

The engineer requesting removal must fill out a template in the [internal requests](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/internal-requests/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/GitLab.com%20Pipeline%20minutes%20limit%20removal.md) issue board.
The request must be approved by a manager by commenting on the issue indicating approval.
The support engineer should then follow the [support engineer steps](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/internal-requests/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/GitLab.com%20Pipeline%20minutes%20limit%20removal.md#section-for-the-support-engineer-working-on-this-request) in that template.

If the request is for not for CI pipeline minute removal but for a reset (which will reset the usage back to `0`) please indicate that requirement.

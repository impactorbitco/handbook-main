title: Public Sector Knowledge Base
description: GitLab Public Sector Knowledge Base
---

The knowledge base (KB) is a repository of solutions to commonly-encountered problems, created and maintained by Support Engineers (SE).
The knowledge base turns the effort used to solve a single ticket for one customer into a trusted resource.

**Knowledge base articles can be found here**

- [US Public Sector support knowledge base](https://federal-support.gitlab.com/hc/en-us/sections/29015014994068-Knowledge-Base)
- [Global support knowledge base](https://support.gitlab.com/hc/en-us/sections/15215649512604-Knowledge-Base)

**Benefits**:

- Deflects ticket creation
- Resolves user problems faster
- Creates consistent, standard answers
- Creates an environment of trust
- Gives Support more time to focus on harder issues or improvements

## Principles

- **Turn it into a habit.** If the issue is worth solving, it is worth saving.
  - Start a knowledge article every time you solve a problem for a customer, a team member or yourself.

- **Accelerate knowledge capture.** Our tools and processes should enhance the speed at which we add knowledge to the Knowledge Base.
  - Capture Knowledge in the moment when the context is clearest and we are able to access customer feedback.
  - Provide feedback as soon as possible if you find a better way to do something.

- **Capture customer context.** Prioritize capturing the right knowledge, in the context of the customer.
  - Focus on documenting the errors and issue as described by the customer for improved findability from other users.
  - Include clear steps and context when documenting solutions. When in doubt, ask, [would Josh Darnit be able to do it?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDA3_5982h8)

- **Always be iterating.** The Knowledge Base is as much for us as for our customers. We review and update knowledge as we use and reuse it.
  - Reuse is Review: We improve the quality of our knowledge by always iterating.

## How Knowledge Articles differ from docs

The Knowledge Base and our product documentation are both key elements of GitLab's digital support experience that serve different needs.
See [examples and learn more here](../knowledge-base/docs-vs-kb/)

### Docs

Docs answer: "How does this work?"

- Offers comprehensive information about product features, architecture and usage
- Provides an overview of the current version of our products
- Is often more technical and detailed
- Is updated less frequently (new feature releases)
- Is primarily created for engineers, advanced users, product details

### Knowledge Articles

Knowledge Articles answer: "How do I fix this?"

- Solves problems encountered while using our products
- Provides solutions to common issues and questions
- Is typically task oriented and includes videos, screenshots
- Is updated frequently based on new issues, new workarounds, new troubleshooting and feedback
- Is primarily created for customer self-service

## Why you should create a knowledge article

Knowledge articles help users to do tasks, get answers to questions and fix issues they may encounter while using our products.

Creating a clear, well-written knowledge article empowers customers to solve issues on their own and helps Support Engineers quickly access accurate, consistent information. Knowledge articles build trust and ensure reliable, repeatable support experiences.

We use *types* of knowledge to efficiently provide the information. This includes:

- How-To
- Break/Fix
- FAQ (Question and answer)
- Troubleshooting

## When to create a knowledge article

You should create an article when someone will benefit from the information.

Some questions to consider:

- Will it help someone find information quickly?
- Does it answer a common question / issue?
- Does it document a repeatable way to do something?
- Will it help a customer get what they need without Support intervention?
- Is this information that may need frequent updates?
- Is this a new issue (with or without a solution) that may cause an influx of support tickets?

## What can be / should be part of a Knowledge Article?

- Overview
- Step by Step Procedures
- Workarounds, Root Cause
- Videos (Link to videos)
- Screenshots (be careful to refrain from adding screenshots of personal identifiable information)
- References (be careful not to use internal links if the article is external)

### What Training is Available for Knowledge Articles in ZenDesk?

A list of available training can be found in [Knowledge Base Training Resources](../knowledge-base/knowledge-base-training).

## Implementation

We use **ZenDesk** to create, modify, and  publish knowledge base articles.
Follow the [training to create a knowledge article](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zEJHhkIxdhYFnOEJrzw3uinXhrvKtvA17Gn7AmZR9yg/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.4d11fzkgmi1w) in ZenDesk.

If you are NOT a ZenDesk User, and want to create a knowledge article, you can do so externally!  Follow the process below.

**How to create a knowledge article if you are not in ZenDesk**

1. Go to the [Folder and choose a template](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hpHAB51x49bRS1tfUqxiQ56UnlITtFHR)
2. Create the article using the template and Save the document.
3. Use the Knowledge Slack Channel [#spt_knowledge-base](https://gitlab.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C07QDCG4AGH) to request the article to be created. Please tag {{< member-by-name "Kirsty Allen" >}} . OR you can Create an ISSUE and Assign to {{< member-by-name "Kirsty Allen" >}}
4. Your Article will be created in ZenDesk and assigned to a reviewer & then Published. You will be notified of Publication.

**Light Agents**

If you are a Light Agent in ZenDesk and would like to **create knowledge articles** please do the following:

- Fill out an [Access Request Form](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/team-member-epics/access-requests/-/issues/new?description_template=Individual_Bulk_Access_Request)
- Request Access to have your Light Agent Role elevated to "create knowledge"
- Request should include Request Reason:  **Write access for articles**
- Request should include if this is for **Global, US Gov, or Both**
- Assign to your Manager for Approval.  **Manager Approval is Required!**

### Integrating with Zendesk offers the following benefits

- Centralized Knowledge Base
- Scalable and Customizable
- Seamless Integration with Ticket
- Improved Support Engineer Productivity
- Streamlined Analytics and Reporting
- Streamline "Knowledge Centered Service" (KCS), adopting knowledge into the workflow
Note: Knowledge base articles are dynamically suggested to a user while submitting a ticket.

### Roles and Permissions

There are four roles for Knowledge:

- **Knowledge Contributors**: Create, update and use KB articles in tickets.
- **Technical Reviewers**: Will review an article for technical accuracy before it is published.
- **Knowledge Champions (Coaches)**: Create, Modify, Review, publish, as well as Mentor Junior Members (knowledge), identify opportunities for knowledge.
- **Knowledge Admins**:  Ensure processes are followed, assist with archive, restore.

Most Knowledge Base tasks are performed within the Zendesk platform (Support and Knowledge Portal). However, some tasks by Knowledge Admins will require manual work outside of Zendesk.

Please see the  [Knowledge Roles Permissions, and Responsibilities](/handbook/support/knowledge-base/knowledge-roles/) page for more information.

**Knowledge Contributors**

Everyone can contribute to knowledge! The most important thing is to capture the knowledge you've created while solving a problem.
The review process will ensure the content is technically accurate and clear.

**Technical Reviewers**

There will be Support Engineers and Support Managers trained as technical reviewers for knowledge articles across the globe.

[Available Technical Reviewers (by region and subject)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14CIIVup-tS5HdLyl0wInf-2m50AptauyhG-ZW5uhs-I/edit?gid=0#gid=0)

Technical Reviewers can now also be found under Column 4 (Looking to Help others) on the [Skills by Subject Page](https://gitlab-com.gitlab.io/support/team-pages/skills-by-subject.html) Technical Reviewers should be Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) in certain areas (Such as Runner, Authentication, Migrations, etc.). The Technical Reviewers are tasked with **reviewing knowledge articles** based on their knowledge of features.

**Technical Reviewer Responsibilities**

Technical Reviewers are expected to:

- Prioritize and Normalize checking the **Manage Articles list** as part of their daily workflow and routine.
- Collaborate with Knowledge article contributors on the technical accuracy of the content, prioritizing having updates published as soon as possible.
- Technically review knowledge articles and determines if the article can be Published for customers (or should remain internal).
- Understands the material and requirements for the article being published.
- Identify trends and opportunities from reporting.
- Provides feedback for knowledge articles.

**Knowledge Champion**

A knowledge champion is someone who will advocate for knowledge, promote KCS and knowledge articles, as well as assist with  driving knowledge management for the product/features. The knowledge champion will help bridge the gap between knowledge and support engineers.

**Knowledge Champions will**:

- Help Mentor Junior Support team members around knowledge
- Find areas where we have opportunities for knowledge, gaps, risks.
- Assist with the knowledge Review Process
- Assist with Technical Reviews when needed
- Attend Once a Month Team KM meeting (to discuss issues/information)

### Linking knowledge and other Content to Support Tickets

**Are you Linking Content to a Support Ticket?**

Did you know that it can be a document or a knowledge article?   Linking ‘any’ knowledge to a support ticket creates a critical feedback loop for us. It provides valuable insights into opportunities, as well as measurements.  We have not yet made it a  “mandatory process” (yet).  HOWEVER, We need and want this to become the norm’ for you during your support workflow. Try it!

**How can YOU help?**

We have the capability to Link knowledge throughout the lifecycle of the ticket (not just at Resolution), however,  we should make sure we link before resolving the ticket completely.
Note: Not **EVERY** ticket will require a link. Do not just link for the sake of linking. Link knowledge when it adds value, not just to check a box. It should be helpful!

**How do I link**

- Use the Knowledge Capture app (on the right side when you are in a support ticket)
- Use the **Search**- to search for an article or a document.
- You can view the article in the ticket view or you can view it on the page view.
- Use the link icon to link the article or document to the Support Ticket.

**When to Link:**

- When an article, document or issue is used to Solve the problem
- It Benefits the customer
- It helped in your research for the support ticket
- Provides knowledge for you and the customer

**When NOT to Link:**

- The article doesn't cover anything with the support ticket (doesn't help)
- The article wasn't really used to help support the issue
- Is being used to just to close (doesn't match the issue of the ticket)

Link content when there's real value in the connection. The goal is to build intelligence around support tickets (What documentation helps, Where gaps exist, what could have been deflected).

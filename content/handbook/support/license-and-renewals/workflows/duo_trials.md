## General Workflows and Guidelines

In general, Support Engineering does not have much control over Duo trials. These are mostly managed by Sales through $0 orders.

In responding to internal requests related to Duo trials, if we are unable to assist the requestor, we should direct them to sales who can access the [Duo trial guidance in Highspot](https://gitlab.highspot.com/items/6813d316f55e5b1787cb1baf?lfrm=srp.0#9) for most answers.
Customer requests should be directed to Sales either by reaching out to them directly or by submitting a request using the [Contact Sales form](https://about.gitlab.com/sales/).

We can also initiate contact with sales in the trial request channel, or if they are an existing customer, by using the [working with sales workflow](working_with_sales.md).

### A note about downgrading Duo Trials

This currently isn't possible and the requester will either need to talk to sales (if the customer requested it) or work with the #duo-trial-requests or sales support (if an internal request).

Below is information on how to work with Duo trials, on each type of offering.

## GitLab.com (SaaS) Duo Trials

GitLab.com trials can be extended using the normal [trial extension workflow](/handbook/support/license-and-renewals/workflows/saas/trials_and_plan_change/#extending-trials). Just ensure that you choose the right plan, either `Ultimate Saas Trial W Duo Enterprise Trial Plan` for non-customers or `Ultimate Saas Trial Paid Customer W Duo Enterprise Trial Plan` for current customers with a subscription.

## Self-Managed / Dedicated Duo Trials

Self-Managed Duo trials should be $0 offers from the Sales Team. This means that Support Engineering has no real way to extend, modify or manage these like any other non-trial subscription.

These should be handled like normal subscriptions, with the only exception that we can email them to a non registered contact as they are considered trials.

Internal requesters should be advised to reach out to #duo-trial-requests if the request is about starting a trial. If they are looking to change or modify a trial then Sales Support is the right direction for guidance.

## We are now part of the CorpSec Team

The IT End User Services (EUS) team is now part of CorpSec. This move allows us to better align ourselves with GitLab's security goals and provide faster and better support to all GitLab members.

Please visit our updated pages [here](/handbook/security/corporate/end-user-services/).

Of course, you can also still reach out to us in the #it_help Slack channel or via our email address it-help@gitlab.com.

## Enterprise Data Catalog

### Overview

The Enterprise Data Catalog is GitLab's central repository for discovering, understanding, and managing our data assets. It serves as the centralised single source of truth for metadata about our enterprise data and helps team members find, understand, and trust the data they need for analysis and decision-making.

Our data catalog is powered by [Atlan](https://atlan.com/), a modern data workspace that combines data discovery, governance, and collaboration capabilities in a single platform.

### Purpose

The Enterprise Data Catalog enables GitLab team members to:

- **Discover data assets** across our organization's data ecosystem
- **Understand data context** through comprehensive metadata, documentation, and lineage information
- **Trust data sources** with visibility into certification status, data quality metrics, and ownership
- **Collaborate** with data owners and other stakeholders
- **Govern data** through consistent classification, tagging, and management

### Key Features

- **Comprehensive data inventory**: Catalog of all enterprise data assets including datasets, dashboards, and other data artifacts
- **Rich metadata**: Technical metadata, business definitions, data lineage, and quality metrics
- **Search and discovery**: Powerful search capabilities to find relevant data assets
- **Governance controls**: Certification status, ownership information, and data classification

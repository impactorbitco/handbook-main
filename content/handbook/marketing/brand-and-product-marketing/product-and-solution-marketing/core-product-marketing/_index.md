### Sales Collaboration

In additional to enabling sales, PMMs should partner with sales and actively engage with the sales proecess by listening to call recordings and joining customer calls with reps. There are several outcomes that result from this process:

1. Improved Messaging - test messaging directly on end customers to gauge their reaction and get feedback. Understand their pain points and values in order to use them to fuel your messaging.
2. Know the buyers journey end-to-end - understand the stages of the buyer process by actively engaging with them.
3. Assist sales on key deals - PMM can serve as product and market SMEs who can tell the story of thier solutions in a compelling way to help move key deals forward.
4. Product management (PM) triage/assist/feedback -As part of the PM <> PMM partnership PMMs can recommend customers they've talked to their PMs to enage with and assist in the gathering of product feedback during customer calls to share with the PM. Similarly, PMs can share messaging feedback, buyer persona info, and sales process insights they gather on calls with customers with their PMMs.

### Metrics and Measures

1. ARR per solution: Product Marketing Managers are the "Product Managers of Marketing". In the same way a Product Manager is responsible for the product research & development, the Prouct Marketing Manager is responsible for the product go-to-market. In the same way PMs don't have direct authority over engineering, but they collaborate and lead by influence, PMMs don't have direct autority over sales and marketing execution but they collaborate and lead by influence.
    - At GitLab, PMs are measured on usage of their product area even though they don't have complete control over all of the factors that drive usage, it is a good proxy to help them make decisions that best impact the user.
    - At GitLab, PMMs are measure on ARR of their solution(s) even though they don't have complete control over all of the factors that drive ARR, it is a good proxy to help them make decisions that best impact the buyer at every stage of the funnel/buyer journey.

## <i class="fas fa-bullhorn"></i> Welcome to the GitLab Product Marketing Handbook

We develop insights, positioning, and messaging that communicate the value of our [core platform](/handbook/marketing/brand-and-product-marketing/product-and-solution-marketing/core-product-marketing/) and our [vertical / horizontal solutions](/handbook/marketing/brand-and-product-marketing/product-and-solution-marketing/usecase-gtm/) with a unified [content strategy](/handbook/marketing/brand-and-product-marketing/content/).

Our mission is to accelerate GitLab's path to market by developing insights, positioning, and messaging that communicate the value of our platform and solutions.

- We are core to GitLab's go-to-market process, operating at the intersection of product management, sales, customer success, and marketing.
- We help deliver a connected customer experience with every touchpoint reinforcing the brand, values, solutions, and vision of GitLab.
- We create programs and messaging to demonstrate momentum and trust in the market.

We make an impact to GitLab's growth by influencing the market with GitLab's differentiated value. Our responsibilities include:

1. **Build and maintain GitLab's messaging pyramid**, which includes brand messaging (driving emotional value), company messaging (driving economic value), use-case messaging (driving functional value), and product messaging (driving technology value).

2. **Translate GitLab's message into marketing communications, customer / partner advocacy, and growth marketing.** Maintain momentum with minor marketing launches to support monthly product releases, drive bi-annual major marketing launches to capture attention in the market, and support quarterly marketing campaigns that are designed to drive demand from the target customer profiles and segments.

### Ask Product Marketing

All Product and Solution Marketing work is aligned to the overall company and marketing priorities. If you need more immediate attention please send a message with a link to the issue you created in the `#ask-product-marketing` slack channel.

### Go-to-market (GTM) Strategies

We develop and champion **go-to-market strategies** that take into account our sales goals, product strengths/limitations, and marketing vehicles. These strategies include recommendations on product and solution areas upon which to focus our marketing and sales efforts and provide supporting messaging, positioning, personas, key assets/content, demos, sales enablement, and more. We deliver our stories/messages to customers, analysts, press through collateral, events, customer meetings, etc., where we get first-hand feedback from the audience to iterate and improve our strategies. We champion the customer perspective for continuity of experience across the various customer touchpoints.

Each team within Product Marketing contributes uniquely and equally toward GitLab's comprehensive GTM priorities that includes:

- characteristics of accounts and personas to pursue with marketing and sales,
- routes to market (e.g. direct, channels),
- key messages,
- currated assets/content needed for the buyer's journey,
- key questions for sales to ask, competitive positioning, overcoming objections, other sales resources
- influencing the influencers (press and analysts), responding to analyst RFIs for magic quadrants (MQs) and waves.

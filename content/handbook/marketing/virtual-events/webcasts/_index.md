## Overview {#overview}

<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

There are 3 types of GitLab-hosted webcasts and workshops using the Zoom webcast license and Goldcast, with differing DRIs depending on the webcast goal and owner.

* **[Global Campaign Webcasts](/handbook/marketing/virtual-events/webcasts/#campaign-webcasts):** goal is net new customer acquisition, managed by Global Campaign Managers in **Goldcast**, aligned to campaign themes to drive Marketing Qualified Leads (MQLs) in target accounts.

* **[Technical Demo Series](/handbook/marketing/virtual-events/webcasts/#technical-demo-series):** goal is to increase conversion from Marketing Qualified Leads (MQLs) to Sales Accepted Opportunities (SAO). Tech Demos are managed by Regional Campaign Managers in **Goldcast** and new Tech Demo bundle themes are created in collaboration with the Developer Relations team

* **[Virtual Workshops](/handbook/marketing/virtual-events/webcasts/#field-workshops):** goal is to increase conversion/velocity of MQLs to SAO, and/or SAO to Closed Won, using hands-on labs with demo environment, capped registration, managed by Field Marketing in **Zoom**

## Global Campaign Webcasts {#campaign-webcasts}

<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

Global Campaign webcasts are managed, moderated, and executed by the Campaigns Team in Goldcast, focusing on campaign messaging and priorities as defined in the Marketing Activation House for each fiscal year.

### Submitting a campaign webcast idea {#campaigns-webcast-idea}

<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

Create a [webcast idea issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/demand-generation/campaigns/-/issues/new?issuable_template=idea-webcast) in the campaigns project.

* Campaign managers will consider the alignment to active and planned campaigns
* If the suggeted topic is approved, the campaign manager will change the status label from `status:plan` to `status:wip`, and run with the webcast
* The webcast owner will then begin creation of the epic and related issues, requesting work of relevant teams

## Best Practices {#webcast-best-practices}

<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

`Marketing Programs to review and update against "general virtual events best practices" page`

1. Give yourself at least 30 business days of promotion.
2. Send invitation emails 2 weeks out, 1 week out, and if needed 2 hours before event. Sample emails can be found here.
3. Only send promotional emails Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday for optimal results.
4. Send reminder emails to registrants the day before, and one hour before the event.
5. Host webcasts on a Wednesday or Thursday, see note below about scheduling.
6. Post links to additional, related resources during the event.
7. Include "contact us" information and a clear CTA at the end of the presentation.
8. Video recording of webcast uploaded to YouTube within 24 hours as event occurred.
9. Send the recording to all registrants, whether they attended or not within 48 hours post webcast.
10. Review Zoom's guide on [in person chat](https://support.zoom.com/hc/en/article?id=zm_kb&sysparm_article=KB0064400) which explains the various ways you can utilize the chat feature.

Review GitLab's general [virtual events best practices](/handbook/marketing/virtual-events/#best-practices) for additional suggestions on how to make your virtual event a success.

## Speaker Approval {#webcast-speaker-approval}

<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

Marketing Programs sometimes depend on GitLab's subject matter experts to deliver webcast presentations. However, we must ensure that when we ask a speaker to participate on a webcast that the work is approved. Please use the following guideline when asking a subject matter expert to participate on a webcast.

1. Have a high-level abstract of the content prepared before asking for a presenter.
2. Send the abstract to both the proposed speaker and their manager to review. A speaker is not considered booked unless they have approval from their manager.
3. Address and resolve any concerns regarding the abstract.
4. Once the manager approves and the speaker accepts, you can move forward with the webcast.

## Tips for Speakers {#speaker-tips}

<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

Here are some basic tips to help ensure that you have a good experience preparing for and presenting on a webcast.

### Before Committing {#speaker-before-committing}

Ask us any questions you have about the time commitment etc. and what exactly our expectations are. Talk about it with your manager if you're on the fence about your availability, bandwidth, or interest. Make sure you're both on the same page. We want this to be a meaningful professional development exercise for you, not a favor to us that you're lukewarm about — if you feel that way, none of will be able to do our best job. We'll be honest with you, so please do the same for us.

### Before the Dry Run {#speaker-before-dry-run}

Select and set up your presentation space. Pick a spot with good wifi, and we recommend setting up an external mic for better audio quality, although this is optional. If you will be presenting from your home, alert your spouse/roommates of the time/date & ask them to be out of the house if necessary. Depending on your preferences and comfort level with public speaking, run through the script several times.

### Before the Presentation {#speaker-before-presentation}

Try to get a good sleep the night before, and, if the presentation is in the morning, wake up early enough to run through your notes at least once. Review our [Positioning FAQ](/handbook/marketing/positioning-faq/), or keep the page handy in case you are asked in the Q&A about how GitLab compares to our competitors.

## Technical Demo Series {#technical-demo-series}

<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

* Technical demos are aligned with the GTM Motions and cover a range of topics relevant to leads in consideration & purchase stages.
* Demo series run on a bi-weekly cadence as live or pre-recorded sessions on Goldcast Platform. Participants have the flexibility to engage in either written or live Q&A sessions.

**Key objectives:**

* **Pipeline Acceleration:** Increase conversion from Marketing Qualified Leads (MQL) to Sales Accepted Opportunities (SAO).
* **Prospect and Customer Education:** Inform our prospects and existing customers about the value offered by GitLab's features.

### Technical demo landing pages {#technical-demo-landing-pages}

<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

Technical Demo Series are managed by Marketing Campaign team, in collaboration with DevRel and Solution Architects who deliver the content.

Global Campaign Managers are responsible for creating technical demo bundles as a pivotal element within the overarching Go-To-Market (GTM) Campaign strategy. Regional Campaign Managers are responsible for activation in the region as integral part of the regional demand generation plans.

Regional Campaign Managers are responsible for updating the technical demo page through our Decap CMS:

* [Global Technical Demo Page](https://about.gitlab.com/gitlab-technical-demo-series/)

To add your event to the page or make any changes to existing events, please see the instructions [here](/handbook/marketing/digital-experience/decap-cms/#adding-an-event-to-the-events-landing-page).

## Logistical Setup {#logistical-setup}

## Adding your webcasts into the calendar {#add-to-calendar}

<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

### Goldcast Webcast Calendar {#bt-calendar}

<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

[Goldcast webcast calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/1?cid=Y19xdTVqMzRsZ2ZrcmlybmM5aGx1MWRkams0MEBncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t) is used to log all planned and scheduled Goldcast webcasts and their related dry runs. **The purpose of the Goldcast webcast calendar is to avoid scheduling overlapping webcasts and to provide visibility into all Goldcast webcasts across teams.**

**Adding to the calendar:**

1. Add tentative webcasts to the calendar with `[Hold]`
   * ex. `[Hold] TALK | 7 secrets of effective GitOps`
   * For dry run (practice) webcasts, add `DR` (ex. `[Hold DR] TALK | 7 secrets of effective gitops`)
   * Include a link to the issue in the event description
1. When the date/time/speakers of the webcast has been confirmed, remove `[Hold]` from the event title
   * ex. `TALK | 7 secrets of effective GitOps` or `RP | 7 secrets of effective GitOps`
   * Add the time of the webcast on the calendar event (if it is still an all-day event)
   * Add the epic link, and remove the issue link, in the calendar description
   * Add all presenters (internal GitLab team members and external speakers)
   * Add Goldcast login information for presenters

### Zoom Webcast Calendar {#zoom-calendar}

<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

The Field Marketing team manages the [zoom webcast license calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar?cid=Z2l0bGFiLmNvbV8xcXZlNmc4MWRwOTFyOWhldnRrZmQ5cjA5OEBncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t), which will be used to log all planned and scheduled Field Marketing hosted webcasts/workshops and their related dry runs. **The purpose of the webcast calendar is to ensure Field Marketers don't schedule overlapping webcasts when using the shared webcast license and to provide executive visibility into all webcasts being hosted.**

Anyone desiring to reserve the zoom license for a webcast must submit a [Zoom license date request](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/demand-generation/campaigns/-/issues/new?issuable_template=zoom-license-date-request) - please note that speakers must be secured and all details in the issue must be provided or the request will be rejected.

**Planned webcasts:**

1. As soon as an issue is created for a webcast request, add the planned webcast to the webcast calendar by creating an event on the day you plan to host the webcast. For webcasts that are still in planning, use the following naming convention `[Hold WC Hosted] Webcast title` (e.g: `[Hold WC Hosted] Mastering CI`) and create it as an all-day event (no time slot selected). Make sure to also include the link to the issue in the calendar description.

**Confirmed Webcasts**

1. Once the date/time of the webcast has been confirmed, go to your calendar event and remove `Hold` from the event title `[WC Hosted] Webcast title` (e.g: `[WC Hosted] Mastering CI`). Specify the time on the calendar event and swap the issue link in the calendar description with the Epic link. *Note: In the spirit of efficiency, please be sure to add all presenters (GitLab team members and external speakers), the epic or issue (if you have one) and your Zoom invite info to the calendar invite so you're not having to create multiple calendar invites.*
1. Make sure to also add dry runs to the webcast calendar. When creating the webcast dry run event(s), please use the following naming convention `[DR WC Hosted] Webcast title` (e.g: `[DR WC Hosted] Mastering CI`) and specify the date/time on the calendar event.

## Goldcast Webcast Setup {#Goldcast-setup}

<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

### Event Creation in Goldcast (Preferred method)

#### Step 1: Initial Setup

1. Click the + icon in the top right of Goldcast
2. Select your event type from primary options (all options are available here > lined to the second above)
3. For Auto-Marketo Program Creation: Choose the appropriate template for the event type

Note: All localized templates automatically create Marketo programs

#### Step 2: Basic Information

Fill in the following fields (most auto-populate into Marketo program tokens):

* Title
* Date
* Start Time
* End Time
* Timezone
* Type: Live or Pre-recorded

#### Step 3: Template and Configuration

1. **Select Template**: Covers registration page, emails, stage design, and form format
2. **Add Tags**: Region, topic, team, etc. for better reporting
3. **Workspace**: Use GitLab Inc Team Workspace for standard events
4. **Repeating Events**: Available but not fully tested with Marketo integration

#### Step 4: Event-Specific Options (New Event Only)

Access additional customization in the Program menu:

* Agenda: Customize sessions for multi-session events + where you add your events assets (polls, surveys, docs, video, slides etc.)
* [Rooms](https://help.goldcast.io/rooms-booths/16634717473179-how-to-create-rooms): Rooms are spaces attendees can have smaller group conversations and networking opportunities
* [Booths](https://help.goldcast.io/rooms-booths/16633523675419-how-to-create-booths): Booths are an opportunity for your attendees to directly engage with event sponsors, or consume content about your company, products, and more. Your event may include a maximum of two Booth tabs.

*Note: Session names and times appear on external landing pages unless disabled.*

#### Step 5: Test Event Toggle

* Toggle “Test event” should be ON if you have a test event, if it’s a live event, please ensure the toggle is OFF.
* Test Event Limitations:
  * Maximum 10 registrants
  * No recording capability
  * Cannot convert to on-demand viewing

More about it [here](https://help.goldcast.io/en_US/virtual-events/16616311404315-getting-started-with-goldcast-setting-up-running-an-event#test-event-12/).

#### Step 6: Marketo Program Management

If the Marketo program cloning feature worked correctly, Goldcast will have created a new Marketo program based on your Goldcast event within the `Templates - Goldcast Webcasts` folder or within whichever folder the program template lives in Marketo.

The name given to the new Marketo program will match the Goldcast event, plus a timestamp.

Rename the Marketo program to fit the regular naming convention (e.g., `YYYYMMDD_EventName_Webcast_Goldcast_template`) and move the program to the appropriate folder for the FY/quarter within Marketo.

*Note: Renaming doesn't affect sync or Goldcast event*

### Event Creation in Marketo

#### Step 1: Program Setup

1. Duplicate the template labeled for the event type
2. Move to appropriate quarter folder
3. Follow standard naming convention

#### Step 2: Get Program ID

1. Navigate to your program in Marketo
2. Find Program ID in URL: classic/ME**00000**A1
3. Copy the number between the letters (e.g., 24014)

#### Step 3: Goldcast Event Creation

1. Create event in Goldcast
2. Template Selection: Choose `GitLab Primary Template (w/o Marketo program creation)`

*Note: This option not available for localized templates*

With a Marketo program created before the Goldcast event, there is no need to have Goldcast create a new Marketo program.

#### Step 4: Connect Programs

1. In Goldcast, navigate to your event
2. Go to: **Integrations** → **Marketo** → **Settings**
3. Enter Program ID in `Connected Program ID field`
4. Click **Connect**

#### Step 5: Confirmation

Once connected, Marketo program tokens will automatically populate, confirming successful integration.

### Different scenarios

| Scenario | Recommended Method | Template Choice |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
|   Simple workflow, want auto-creation    |   Goldcast First    | GitLab Primary Template (auto-Marketo), GitLab Roundtable Template (auto-Marketo) or GitLab Workshop Template - (auto-Marketo program creation)  |
|   Need custom Marketo setup first |  Marketo First  | GitLab Primary Template (w/o Marketo) |
| Localized event | Goldcast First | Localized Template |
| Dry runs/Testing | Goldcast First | GitLab Primary Template (auto-Marketo), GitLab Roundtable Template (auto-Marketo) or GitLab Workshop Template - (auto-Marketo program creation) |

### Important Notes

* Program ID Changes: Renaming Marketo programs doesn't affect the Goldcast sync
* Token Population: Occurs automatically once programs are connected
* RTMP Feature: The RTMP type is a feature that allows embedding to or from external tools and there are currently no plans to use this feature. Please ping MktgOps if there is a request to try it

## Program Member Status Processing

When the Goldcast event and Marketo program are connected, Goldcast will automatically change the program status for all members without the need for a smart campaign. However, processing smart campaigns are still needed for other data appending requirements:

### Smart campaigns for Marketo landing page based registration

* `01a Marketo Form Registration`: This smart campaign **must** be active for Marketo LP registrations. Without this smart campaign, registrants will not be added to the Goldcast event and will not receive a registration confirmation email. Once the event is over, turn this smart campaign off
* `01c Marketo Form Fill Waitlist`: If registration has maxed out for the event, deactivate the `Registration` smart campaign and turn this one on to add regsitrants to the waitlist
* `01e Waitlist to Registered`: If you plan to change registrants who are currently listed as `Waitlisted` to `Registered`, turn this smart campaign on first. It refreshes the `Interesting Moment` and calls the Goldcast webhook

### Additional smart campaigns

* `02 Goldcast Form Registration and Live`: Goldcast automatically changes program statuses when events and Marketo programs are connected. This smart campaign watches for program status changes for `Attended`, `No Show`, `Canceled`, `Rejected`, `Waitlisted` and `Registered`. If the event's registration is started on a Goldcast landing page, this smart campaign needs to be turned on immediately and before invite emails are sent out to invitees. This smart campaign needs to be active before the event, regardless of registration landing page location. The flow can safely be set to automatically expire 24 hours after the event ends
* `03 Goldcast Processing - On Demand - Goldcast/Pathfactory`: This smart campaign is designed to process `on-demand` attendees based on either Goldcast post-event viewing, On-demand form fills or Pathfactory viewing. The flow needs to be turned on within 30 minutes of the webcast ending to work correctly for Goldcast on-demand attendees but is not required to be on prior to the event's end and likely should not be activated until then. Have Pathfactory keywords in-mind or ready so those filters can be added to the trigger and the flow can be activated before the 35 minute mark post-event. For the flow to work on landing pages for on-demand form fills, the Marketo landing page form needs to be switched to `FORM 2076: On-demand Webcast`
* `04 Goldcast Processing - Follow Up Requested`: If an attendee clicks the CTA button -which by default is labeled as `Talk to an Expert`- in either an Event or in a Booth, this flow marks those leads as the `Follow Up Requested` program status. In order for this flow to work, it must be active and needs to have the event ID place in the trigger filter. Otherwise the CTA button will not MQL the lead for follow up. CTA click numbers are also available to reference in the Goldcast event analytics dashboard. Note that the CTA button simply links to the "talk to sales" page during `on demand` events and on the registration landing page - and this flow does not need to be activated for `on demand`. It is up to the discretion of the team member to turn off this functionality within the Goldcast event by hiding all `CTA` buttons. The Marketo smart campaign can safely be set to automatically expire 24 hours after the event ends

### Goldcast Webcast Invitations {#goldcast-webcast-invitations}

<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

1. Update emails `Invitation 1 - 2 weeks prior`,  `Invitation 2 - 1 week prior` , and if needed `Invitation 3 - Day before` with relevant copies related to the webcast.
   * *Note: We normally use the same copy for all 3 emails and simply tweak the templated subject lines to sound more like "Reminders".*
2. Approve copy and send samples to the requester, and the presenter (if different from requester).
3. Go to the `List` folder and edit the `Target List` smart list and input the names of past similar programs and applicable program statuses to the `Member of program` filter. This will make sure people that have attended programs with similar topics in the past are included in the invite.
   * Note: We may uplevel this logic to include webcast invitations within active nurture programs to limit the overhead for invitation emails.

### How to add webcast to `about.gitlab.com/events`

In an effort to publicly share where people can find GitLab for virtual events and events in-person throughout the world, we have created [about.gitlab.com/events](https://about.gitlab.com/events/). This page is to be updated by the person responsible for the event. This page is now managed through [Decap CMS](/handbook/marketing/digital-experience/decap-cms/). To add your event to the page or make any changes to existing events, please see the instructions [here](/handbook/marketing/digital-experience/decap-cms/#adding-an-event-to-the-events-landing-page).

Goldcast will automatically convert the video to on-demand in the Goldcast platform. The steps below allow us to further leverage the webcast in Pathfactory. If you are going to drive to Goldcast directly for On-demand viewing (such as for large corporate events), skip to the instructions below starting at `Using Goldcast for On-Demand Viewing`.

1. **Vimeo**: vimeo provides an ads free user expierence, therefore should be primary video platform used for on-demand recording uploads. To request an upload, open [an issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/inbound-marketing/global-content/digital-production/-/issues/new?issuable_template=upload-request) with Digital Production Team.
   * Instructions on uploading Vimeo videos to Pathfactory can be found [here](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/pathfactory/content-library/#vimeo-links)
1. **YouTube**: upload the recording to our main GitLab channel:
   * Fill in the title with the webcast title matching the Marketo token (`{{my.webcastTitle}}`)
   * Fill in the description with the short description matching the Marketo tokens (`{{my.contentDescription}}`)
   * Make sure the video is set as `Unlisted` so only people with the URL to the video can find it
1. **YouTube**: Once the recording has been uploaded, copy the video link on the right
1. **Pathfactory**: Login to PathFactory and add the YouTube or Vimeo link to Pathfactory as new content by following the instructions outlined [here](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/pathfactory).

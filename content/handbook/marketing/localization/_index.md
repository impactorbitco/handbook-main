## Introduction

Localization team collaborates with the Marketing, Sales, Product and Engineering [divisions](/handbook/company/structure/#organizational-structure), as well as external partners (vendors) and the wider community of translators, to enable GitLab's global  reach and user experience across key pillars: Marketing (about.gitlab.com), Editorial (blogs), Product, Documentation, and Enablement (support, customer success, etc.).

The team's key initiatives include increasing our non-English blog publishing cadence and performance, localizing the marketing website pages, enabling the localization of docs.gitlab.com, launching the terminology management system, deploying cutting-edge Generative AI and machine translation solutions, expanding into customer-facing programs such as localization of Support content and training & certification materials, and supporting all of the above by the localization technology platform and tooling.

Our ability to support regional teams with localized product documentation, marketing content, and customer success materials directly impacts GitLab's ability to grow in global markets.

## Localization Technology Management

The Localization team is managing the diverse technology stack consisting of several purpose-built solutions, as well as commercial Language Technology Platforms (LTPs) for managing the localization of GitLab product UI, marketing website and GitLab product documentation:

- The [Localization Request Management system](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/localization/-/epics/35) and its suite of integrations and microservices, aka Argo
- The [GitLab Translation Service](/handbook/engineering/architecture/design-documents/gitlab_translation_service/) aka [Argo GitLab Integration](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/localization/argo-gitlab-integration)
- Argo integrations and automations between LTPs (language technology platforms), such as [TranslationOS](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/localization/-/epics/92) and [Phrase TMS](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/localization/-/epics/95), and GitLab projects and systems, such as [Decap CMS](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/localization/-/epics/83)
- Purpose-built custom AI-powered solutions for machine translation and localization-adjacent tasks for GitLab product documentation. See project [Tech Docs AI-powered translation](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/localization/tech-docs-ai-powered-translation)
- Purpose-built custom solutions for context-enhanced localization of GitLab product UI, using [Crowdin](/handbook/business-technology/tech-stack/#crowdincom). See project [GitLab String Search](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/localization/gitlab-string-search), epic [Implement and launch the string search context-enhancement solution as Pages website](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/localization/localization-team/-/issues/342), project [Crowdin Automation](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/localization/crowdin-automation), and project [crowdin-translation-sync](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/frontend/crowdin-translation-sync)
- [Argo GitLab Agent](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/localization/argo-gitlab-agent), a purpose-built service as a  component of the Argo ecosystem for specialized localization-related tasks, such as file pre- / post-processing, etc.
- Terminology management system - [Kalcium Quickterm](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/localization/-/epics/51)

## How to submit translation requests to the Localization team

**Primary method**
Submit an issue through our [Localization Issue Tracker](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/localization/issue-tracker/-/issues/new?issuable_template=localization-request) when your content is ready for localization or review.

Note: While you can contact the Translated or Argos Multilingual team directly via Slack in `#translated-team` or `#argos_multilingual`, we prefer submission through the Issue Tracker.

**Additional support**
For general localization questions:

- Join our `#localization` Slack channel
- Add the L10n-attention label to issues, epics, or merge requests
- Here you can view the status of current localization requests: [Issue Tracker Board](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/localization/issue-tracker/-/boards/7726880)

### When to engage with us

We recommend connecting with the Localization team early in your planning, especially for global initiatives affecting users across all regions that have a specific timeline. While we can't begin translations until content is finalized and approved, early collaboration during planning and design will ensure success.

### Internal reviews

We are managing the internal review process by working with language leads and contractors, so that our in-market GitLab teams can focus on their normal duties. Please note, however, that we may need to engage the internal review team from time to time, as our new teams ramp up and build the context they need to successfully localize our content in a way that aligns to GitLab and local expectations.

Our internal reviewers are volunteer GitLab employees. We completely appreciate that this task is on top of your day job and will continue to respect that. Both translation and reviews are conducted in Translated tooling; processes for review are currently a work in progress.

## Localization of GitLab product documentation site (docs.gitlab.com)

We are working on localizing GitLab product documentation. To learn more, go to the [Localization of GitLab Product Documentation](tech_docs_localization.md) Handbook page, see the [Docs Site Localization project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/localization/docs-site-localization) and follow the [Localization of GitLab Product Documentation epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/localization/-/epics/14).

## Marketing Localization

GitLab marketing website is being continuously localized and maintained in 6 languages. GitLab's international blog is available in Japanese, French and German, with a dedicated content manager. To learn more, go to the [Marketing Localization](marketing_localization.md) Handbook page.

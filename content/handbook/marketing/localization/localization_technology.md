## Mission and vision

[Localization technology at GitLab - mission and vision](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/localization/localization-team/-/issues/453)

## Localization technology stack - Overview

The Localization team manages a sophisticated technology ecosystem designed to automate and enhance translation workflows across GitLab's global content. Our technology stack consists of purpose-built custom solutions, commercial Language Technology Platforms (LTPs), and emerging AI-powered services that collectively enable localization of GitLab's product UI, marketing content, and product documentation.

## Localization technology stack - Components

See more details and visuals in the [Localization management technology stack at GitLab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/localization/localization-team/-/issues/452) issue.

### Tools inventory

**Commercial Tools:**

- **Argo as a platform, aka Request Management System** and its components (by Spartan Software)
- **Phrase TMS** (by Phrase)
- **TranslationOS (TOS) and Matecat** (by Translated)
- **Crowdin** (by Crowdin)

**At GitLab:**

- Google Cloud Platform sandbox with ai-machine-transl project
- Anthropic Claude UI with emerging standalone projects

### Orchestration platform

**[Argo](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/localization/-/epics/35)** - Localization Request Management system serving as the central orchestration hub, consisting of the following specialized services:

- **Argo web client (UI)** - Argo web UI used by localization program managers, stakeholders and vendors
- **Argo web services** - backend/API orchestration engine  
- **Argo-Phrase integration** - service for GitLab product docs localization workflow
- **Argo-TOS integration** - service for marketing localization workflow
- **Argo-GitLab integration** - service handling webhooks
- **Argo GitLab agent** - service for preprocessing GitLab product docs markdown files
- **Database & reporting** - business analytics and tracking, available within Argo UI

### GitLab integration services

- **[Argo GitLab Integration](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/localization/argo-gitlab-integration)** - [GitLab Translation Service](/handbook/engineering/architecture/design-documents/gitlab_translation_service/) that bridges GitLab projects with translation management systems through webhook automation and Translation MR delivery
- **[Argo GitLab Agent](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/localization/argo-gitlab-agent)** - specialized service for GitLab markdown preprocessing and other content processing tasks

### Integrations with Language Technology Platforms

- **[TranslationOS integration](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/localization/-/epics/92)** - for semi-automated translation workflow for marketing content, via Translated
- **[Phrase TMS integration](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/localization/-/epics/95)** - for automated product documentation translation via Argos Multilingual, with AI enhancement capabilities
- **[Crowdin integration](/handbook/business-technology/tech-stack/#crowdincom)** - for community-driven product UI translation

### AI-powered translation

- **[Tech Docs AI-powered translation](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/localization/tech-docs-ai-powered-translation)** - Google Cloud Vertex AI with Gemini LLM processing GitLab product documentation, using advanced NLP, chained prompt systems, multiple glossaries and style guide injection, and file transformations and validations
- **Emerging AI tools** - standalone AI projects in Claude in the early stages of prototype and trial for translation production, to be transformed into services orchestrated by Argo

### Content management system integrations

- **[Decap CMS integration](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/localization/-/epics/83)** - Marketing website content workflow automation through GitLab repositories
- **Legacy integrations**: [Contentful](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/localization/-/epics/27)

### Supporting tools and services

- **[GitLab String Search](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/localization/gitlab-string-search)** - context-enhanced localization solution for product UI ([implementation epic](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/localization/localization-team/-/issues/342))
- **[Crowdin Automation](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/localization/crowdin-automation)** - automated workflow management for product UI translations
- **[Kalcium Quickterm](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/localization/-/epics/51)** - terminology management system.

## Central content repository

All localization workflows converge through GitLab as the single source of truth for content and translations. This GitLab-centric approach ensures:

- **Version control** for all source and translated content
- **Unified delivery mechanism** through Translation MRs
- **Consistent quality gates** and approval workflows
- **Integrated CI/CD pipelines** for content publishing

## Accelevents Support and Documentation Hub

Detailed and continuously updated documentation from the Accelevents team can be found by following the topic paths [here](https://support.accelevents.com/en/).

## Okta

Logins for Accelvents need to be requested via Lumos because the platform is integrated with SSO/Okta. All users are currently given `Admin` permissions upon a successful Lumos request. If a login does not work after the Lumos request is fulfilled, ping MktgOps to investigate if a user seat was created within Accelevents.

## Accelevents Navigation

Special Note: **DO NOT HAVE MULTIPLE EVENTS OPEN IN THE SAME BROWSER**. This can lead to cache contamination across your events when changing settings.

The Accelevents UX for our instance is split into 2 distinct areas:

- `White Label Plan` Dashboard: This area controls the instance and a number of the instance's settings. Most immediate examples of what to find here: instance-wide integrations, user management, billing, audience analytics (across all events), branding, SSO settings and email+landing page settings.
- `Event Settings` Dashboard: Control settings per event. Examples of things to control within events: changes to form fields here (under `Registration; Order form`), changes to event details (time/date, place, name), select event type (in-person, hybrid, online), create ticket types for attendees (e.g. paid vs free or customer vs partner), create confirmation emails, view attendee lists, select settings for sponsors and control third party integrations at the event level.
  - Custom scripts created by the Accelevents team exist in the `Landing Page` settings, found under `Integrations -> Landing page`. Do not adjsut these settings as doing so will affect registration forms. Consult Accelevents Support or MOps before making any changes

## Event Creation in Accelevents

1. From the Events screen, click on `Templates`
1. Accelevents currently has two primary templates for event scenarios:
   - Use `GitLab Owned + Public Event Template (w/ Marketo connection)` for any event that will be public. This template includes the Marketo integration for transferring registrant info into our CRM
   - Use `Internal GitLab Template (w/o Marketo connection)` for any internal event where registrant info will not be used for sales purposes. This template is not connected to Marketo by default
1. Select the correct template from the options above and select `Use Template (create event)`
   - It's possible to create events from scratch but that is unadvised in some cases. The template `GitLab Owned + Public Event Template (w/ Marketo connection)`has been customized for its use case. The landing page + registration form has been fitted with custom code, meant to fulfill the specific needs of a public event. Additionally, this template has been set to sync leads to Marketo. For internal-only events, it is acceptable to start from scratch or use an "internal" template - but foregoing the template potentially means a longer set up.
1. Name your event
1. Create the Event URL, using our [Landing Page naming convention](/handbook/marketing/demand-generation/campaigns/landing-pages/#landing-page-naming-convention). These naming conventions are used in our reporting systems and will be shown to attendees. This is also how the event will appear in Marketo.
1. The Event Organizer is GitLab Events
1. Click "Create"
1. Update your date, settings, descriptions, location, etc.
1. If you set-up an external facing (Public) event, you must also set-up the Marketo program. After setting up the event in Accelevents, submit a test registration via a form fill. A Marketo program will be automatically created after the first registrant is added to the event.
   - To complete the Marketo set-up, visit the [Campaigns and Programs page](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/campaigns-and-programs/#adding-linkedin-lead-gen-forms-to-drive-event-registration) for detailed instructions to set-up Marketo and SFDC. If you are promoting the event on LinkedIn, you also need to follow the detailed setup instructions on the [Campaigns and Programs page](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/campaigns-and-programs/#adding-linkedin-lead-gen-forms-to-drive-event-registration).
   - Marketo programs created by Accelevents are assigned a name based on the URL of the Accevelents registration landing page and the programs are added to the Marketo folder `Program_Events`. The name and location of the Marketo program cannot be changed or it will break the sync between the two platforms (This remains true as of Aug 2025). The Salesforce campaign name can be changed, however.

**Event Creation for Internal Events - Without a Template (Not Allowed for Public Events)**

1. To create a new event within the Accelevents platform, press the blue `+ Create Event` button found at the top right of the `White Label Plan` dashboard.
2. The prompt will ask to choose if the event format is `Online`, `Hybrid` and `In Person`. The next prompt will ask the event's elements - see Accelevents documentation for more details. For ticketed events, choose `Registration`. The last prompted will be for filling in the event details, like name, location and time/date.
3. Fill in your event details
4. All other steps above apply (Event URL, Marketo set-up)

If an event needs to be deleted, click the 3 dots found to the right of the event name seen on the events list page

### Making Updates to the Registration Forms

The Accelevents team has created many custom scripts that run on registration landing pages. These control many aspects of the registration form's appearance and actions. Any changes to the registration landing pages' form fields need to be tested to verify the custom scripts are not affected.

## Marketo Sync

### Expect more updates for this section

Please note the Accevelents engineering team is updating the Marketo integration. This section will be updated as we learn the progress of new features.

#### Accelevents and Marketo templates

Specific fields within Accelevents run through automations to clean the data for Marketo. Due to conditional formatting on the Accelevents registration form differing from Marketo's conditional formatting, Marketo moves data around for `State`, `Province` and `Territory` values via [this smart campaign](https://experience.adobe.com/#/@gitlab/so:194-VVC-221/marketo-engage/classic/SC63981A1ZN19). Accelevents collects data on those fields separately, Marketo combines them all to the `State` field.

### Fields Being Synced to Marketo

| Field Name | Sync Behavior |

## Google Sheet Integration

GitLab's Google Sheets account has been connected platform-wide to Accelevents and the data exported can be customized for each individual event.

Note: Registration exports to Sheets is only activated **automatically** on events created from the `GitLab Epic Conference Template` template, but can be activated and configured for any event.

To access and customize the Google Sheets export feature, within an event or template click into the event's `Settings` followed by `Integrations`. Under the CRM & Marketing Automation settings, activate/deactivate the export feature via the toggle.

Click `Configure` to map what fields are exported to the Google Sheet. Determine if Accevelents will create its own Sheet or whether the export will be mapped to an existing Sheet here, as well. The file will be saved in the connected Google Drive with the last part of the event URL as the file name. You can move the file to another folder, but do not rename it.

Registrants are exported automatically on form fill so it is best to check the integration is live before opening registration.

Official Accelevents documentation can be found [here](https://support.accelevents.com/en/articles/10085600-integrate-with-google-sheets).

## Stripe Integration

The Stripe integration has been set up to run platform-wide, so implementing on any event form is possible as long as the event was created after the integration was completed. Stripe cannot be retroactively added to created events.

To add Stripe functionality to your event, first create the event. Then follow these steps:

- Create a new ticket with the designated price and the correct quantity for the event. To do this, select `Paid Ticket` in the `Create Ticket` menu
- Set the correct timeframe for when the paid tickets are to go on sale and when they are to go off sale. Determine if GitLab will pay the transaction fee and set the option for the desired outcome
- If desired, input a ticket description and choose if that description will appear on the event's landing page
- Select the confirmation email that will be sent to purchasers
- There are several options to submit for what the ticket will allow, e.g. access to certain sessions, access to lounges and including a PDF ticket as an attachment to the confirmation email. Set these options as desired
- To place a tracking code on Stripe payments and make them easily identifiable within Stripe, within the individual Accelevent event's side bar menu proceed with `Settings` -> `Payment Processing` -> `Event Billing ID`. For incoming Stripe payments to be associated with a specific event, place an identification code unique to the event into this field

## Frequently Asked Questions

Q: If my event is synced to Marketo, do I need to complete a list upload after the event?
A: No. If you check-in registrants at the event, you do not need to complete a separate list load. The registrations will be updated to Attendees in near real-time in both Marketo and SFDC (if you have wifi, otherwise they will update when connected).

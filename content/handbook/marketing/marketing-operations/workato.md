## What is Workato?

Workato is an automation platform that enables us to integrate third party apps and automate business workflows that would otherwise require more resource intensive efforts to achieve the same results.

We have several workflows live in Workato to help marketing processes for data cleanliness, data transfer to Marketo and Iterable, and project creation in Asana. For more information, view the [Internal Workato handbook page](https://internal.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/marketing-ops-and-analytics/marketing-operations/workato/#mops-managed-workato-workflows), or to a function's specific handbook page.

### SaaS Trials and Registrations

Process developed to get lead data into Marketo and SFDC when a new trial is started or certain free SaaS registration is completed on gitlab.com.

This is also being worked on to send to [Iterable](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/iterable/#overview).

### Marketo Form to SFDC case

Process developed at the request of the Sales team to set-up a web form that, once filled, creates a case in Salesforce. This is meant for existing SMB accounts.

### List import Bot

This is an automated workflow for list imports in Marketo. Refer to [handbook page](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/automated-list-import/) for more information.

### Email domain

Process developed to extract the domain from an email address and populate the field `Email Domain` in Marketo.

### Data Clean and Normalization

Process to clean Country values to match exact picklists in SFDC.

### Asana Project Creation

There is a two-way sync between GitLab <> Asana. Read more in the [internal handbook page](https://internal.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/marketing-ops-and-analytics/marketing-operations/asana/#overview).

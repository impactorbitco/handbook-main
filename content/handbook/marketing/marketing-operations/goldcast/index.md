## Important Notes

### Registration Requirements

#### Registration Policy

- Registrations must ONLY occur via Marketo forms/landing pages
- **Do NOT use Goldcast landing pages/forms for registration**
- This restriction is in effect until further notice

#### Technical Access Requirements

- Users must grant microphone and camera permissions to browser/Goldcast
- Failure to grant permissions may prevent event access

![Goldcast Permissions](/images/marketing/marketing-operations/goldcast/goldcast_permissions.png)

### Event Type Selection Guide

#### Live vs Pre-recorded

- Live: Required when speakers appear live on camera
- Pre-recorded: Suitable when no live speakers on camera (Staff can only interact via text with audience)

### New Event vs New Webinar for Mixed Content

#### New Event (Recommended for Mixed Content)

- New Event will give more flexibility for presenters due to the multi-session functionality, which allows for a pre-recorded session and then a live session - but relies on the Session Redirection Strategy setting to determine how to change the sessions over.

#### New Webinar (Simpler Setup)

- New Webinar offers a simpler setup, less flexibility and automotive content creation via Content Lab - but will require Backstage or Speakers to manually control video and other displayed content during live presentations.

Reference: To learn more, please read the Goldcast documentation on [which event type to use](https://help.goldcast.io/en_US/QA-event-setup/which-event-type-to-use/) and [webinars vs events](https://help.goldcast.io/en_US/QA-event-setup/webinars-vs-events/).

### Session Management & Timing

#### Session Redirection Strategy

- Automatic: Allows registrants in at event start, but doesn't force presenters on-stage immediately
- Manual: Requires staff input to move attendees between sessions

More about Session Redirection Strategy [here](https://help.goldcast.io/program-agenda/18803068306459?from_search=181942475&swifty_search_highlight=redirectio/).

The GitLab team has found the Automatic session redirection feature on multi-session Events can be slow, so it is best to familiarize how the feature works and if it would be better to use the manual setting at least an hour before the event starts (when this setting becomes locked).

#### Timing Information

- Settings Lock: Run on the assumption that settings cannot be changed within an hour of your event start time
- On-Demand Conversion: Occurs ~35 minutes after event ends
- Pre-recorded Events: Should be 2+ minutes longer than video asset length

### Content & Media Guidelines

#### Video Specifications & Upload

- File Size Limit: 5GB for standard events (tag Marketing Ops team if the size is larger)
- Processing Time: Up to 4x the video length
- 4K Broadcasts: Any 4K broadcasts require the GitLab team contact Goldcast support as these are deemed “special” events
- [Creative Asset Specs](https://help.goldcast.io/en_US/design/4406894301979-goldcast-design-specifications/)

#### Captions & Language Settings

- Default Language: English (unless template specifies otherwise)
- Default Settings: Captions and subtitles enabled by default (only works correctly if presenters speak in set primary language)
- Custom Subtitles

Uploading our own subtitle/caption files [requires reaching out to Support](https://goldcast.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/26677786827291-Upload-Custom-VTT-Caption-Files-to-Pre-recorded-Sessions/) with the event name/ID and pre-recorded session name. Pre-loaded subtitles are only available for pre-recorded events. The file emailed to Support must be in VTT format and the Support team requests up to 48 hours to implement. Within any event using customized VTT files, **only languages included within the submitted files will be supported** and live captions will be disabled. e.g., if a VTT file includes English, Korean and German, those will be the only available subtitles/captions and Japanese will not be selectable.

### Data & Integration Management

- Field Creation: Custom fields allowed in Goldcast, but Marketo sync controlled by Marketing Ops. **Do not add any fields into the Goldcast -> Marketo sync without consulting Marketing Ops**.

#### Form Management for On-Demand

- To cut down on complexity and strain on Marketo, the Attended On Demand Marketo program flows for Goldcast, On-demand form fills and for Pathfactory are shared. Have Pathfactory keywords in mind or reserved before the webcast air date so this flow can be turned on quickly after the event ends. Once the event is over, either take down the landing page or replace the FORM 1592: Webcast form for the FORM 2076: On-demand Webcast form if the intention is to leave the landing page up for on-demand.

### Event Features & Limitations

#### Test Event Constraints

- Test event becomes non-test event at **10 registrants**. [More info](https://help.goldcast.io/en_US/event-settings/what-is-a-test-event-how-to-create-one/).

#### Landing Page Management

- **Enter Event Button**: the Enter Event button on the registration landing page is recommended to be disabled, if it is not already. If enabled, registrants can enter the event earlier than 1 hour prior to event start. Instructions on disabling the button [here](https://help.goldcast.io/en_US/event-settings/4583663517211-disabling-the-enter-event-button#how-to-turn-off-the-enter-event-button-1/).
- **Goldcast LPs**: Activated by default, cannot be deactivated. We continue using Marketo form and landing pages until further notice.
- **Auto-deactivation**: Goldcast LPs deactivate shortly after event ends.

#### Platform Limitations

- Event Deactivation: No full deactivation feature available (as of April 2025)
- The removal of Goldcast branding, such as surveys and rate us button, are part of the white listing feature and behind a paywall.

### Support & Performance

#### Performance Optimization

- Connection Testing: Guests prompted for connection test before joining (default)
- Lite Mode: May improve performance for users with video/audio issues (see Q4 FAQ for [Lite Mode](https://help.goldcast.io/en_US/for-attendees/9152654198427-goldcast-attendee-faqs/) details)

#### Live Support Access

- To request text-based Live Chat Support during an event and from the Studio dashboard, [click the “?” icon in the top right corner](https://help.goldcast.io/en_US/about-goldcast/16577714397851-how-do-i-contact-goldcast-support-/). Support can share an event checkup to 48 hours prior to the event, if requested, which includes a review of settings.

## Fields syncing between Marketo and Goldcast

List of sync fields in draft currently. Let MOps know of any more fields to consider.

The definition of a `Standard` field vs a `Custom` field is based on what fields are out of the box within Goldcast. Fields labeled as `Standard` have been synced at the instance level, but `Custom` fields are synced on the form object. This means any new forms created that exist outside of the form library will need to have their `Custom` fields synced to Marketo by MOps.

Forms within Goldcast's "form library" are all designed to support UTM parameters and Google Analytics IDs.

| Goldcast Field Name | Marketo Field Name | Update Cadence | Custom or standard field?|
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
|   First Name     |   First Name     | Always update | Standard |
|   Last Name     |  Last Name     | Always uodate | Standard |
| Email| email | Lookup Field | Standard |
|Job Title | Job Title| Only update if target is empty | Standard |
| Company | Company Name| Only update if target is empty|Standard |
|City | City| Only update if target is empty|Standard |
| Country | Country|Only update if target is empty|Standard |
| State |State |Only update if target is empty|Standard |

## Marketo Program Cloning and Tokens

There are twmultiple Marketo program templates to use between event types to accommodate for attribution:

- For webcasts, the template is named `YYYYMMDD_EventName_Webcast_Goldcast_template`
- For workshops it is `YYYYMMDD_EventName_Workshop_Goldcast_template`
- For executive roundtables it is `YYYYMMDD_EventName_Roundtable_Goldcast_template`

All are found in the [Templates - Goldcast Webcasts folder](https://engage-ab.marketo.com/?munchkinId=194-VVC-221#/classic/ME21842A1/). Goldcast can auto-clone Marketo programs based on a template, as long as the Goldcast template is synced to a Marketo program. The Marketo program created will have the same name as the Goldcast event, ending with a time stamp. The new program will appear in the same folder as the original Marketo program.

When working correctly, the Marketo program's tokens will auto-populate - either on program creation (via Goldcast's program cloning feature) or when manually connected to a Goldcast event. The relevant tokens for this process are:

- {{my.goldcast_eventEndDate}}
- {{my.goldcast_eventEndTime}}
- {{my.goldcast_eventId}}
- {{my.goldcast_eventSeriesID}}
- {{my.goldcast_eventSeriesName}}
- {{my.goldcast_eventStartDate}}
- {{my.goldcast_eventStartTime}}
- {{my.goldcast_eventTimezone}}
- {{my.goldcast_eventTitle}}
- {{my.goldcast_formId}}

Additionally, there are tokens within the program that are _not_ updated by Goldcast but are still relevant for various aspects of the program, like the Marketo landing page or Marketo-sent follow up emails. These tokens but are not limited to:

Marketo email tokens

- {{my.utm}}
- {{my.ondemandUrl}}
- {{my.epic link}}
- {{my.landingPageURL}}
- {{my.pfslidelink}}
- {{my.event owner}}

Follow up Emails

- {{my.zzfollow up slides or recording link}}
- {{my.zzFollow up CTA link}}
- {{my.zzFollow up event or asset description}}
- {{my.zzFollow-up short event description}}
- {{my.zzFollow up Event or Asset name}}
- {{my.zzfollow up slides or recording link}}
- {{my.zzFollowup - trial bullets}}

Marketo landing page tokens

- {{my.webcastSubtitle}}
- {{my.introParagraph}}
- {{my.bullet1}}
- {{my.bullet2}}
- {{my.bullet3}}
- {{my.bullet4}}
- {{my.speaker1Name}}
- {{my.speaker1JobTitle}}
- {{my.speaker1Company}}
- {{my.speaker2Name}}
- {{my.speaker2JobTitle}}
- {{my.speaker2Company}}

## Event Types

When creating a new event, you have 3 different choices: New Webinar, New Event and New Series.  Each of these offers slight variation on event attributes and features, with [Webinar and Event seeing the most important differences](https://help.goldcast.io/en_US/QA-event-setup/webinars-vs-events/).

### New Webinar

Best For: Simple, single-format events

- Available broadcast types: Pre-recorded or Live
- Pre-recorded: Staff can only interact via text-based interface with attendees
- Live: Staff/speakers must manually manage all video on stage

### New Event

Best For: Complex, multi-format events

- Supports multi-session events across multiple rooms, times, and days
- Allows mixing of pre-recorded video with live speakers
- Good option for events with live Q&A following pre-recorded content

### New Series

- Functions like a folder to group multiple events/webinars under one label
- See "Working with a Series" section for more details

## Event Creation Options

Users can start event creation in either Goldcast or Marketo. Choose based on your workflow preference and setup requirements.

### Event Creation in Goldcast (Preferred method)

#### Step 1: Initial Setup

1. Click the + icon in the top right of Goldcast
2. Select your event type from primary options (all options are available here > lined to the second above)
3. For Auto-Marketo Program Creation: Choose the appropriate template for the event type

Note: All localized templates automatically create Marketo programs

#### Step 2: Basic Information

Fill in the following fields (most auto-populate into Marketo program tokens):

- Title
- Date
- Start Time
- End Time
- Timezone
- Type: Live or Pre-recorded

#### Step 3: Template and Configuration

1. **Select Template**: Covers registration page, emails, stage design, and form format
2. **Add Tags**: Region, topic, team, etc. for better reporting
3. **Workspace**: Use GitLab Inc Team Workspace for standard events
4. **Repeating Events**: Available but not fully tested with Marketo integration

#### Step 4: Event-Specific Options (New Event Only)

Access additional customization in the Program menu:

- Agenda: Customize sessions for multi-session events + where you add your events assets (polls, surveys, docs, video, slides etc.)
- [Rooms](https://help.goldcast.io/rooms-booths/16634717473179-how-to-create-rooms): Rooms are spaces attendees can have smaller group conversations and networking opportunities
- [Booths](https://help.goldcast.io/rooms-booths/16633523675419-how-to-create-booths): Booths are an opportunity for your attendees to directly engage with event sponsors, or consume content about your company, products, and more. Your event may include a maximum of two Booth tabs.

Note: Session names and times appear on external landing pages unless disabled.

#### Step 5: Test Event Toggle

- Toggle “Test event” should be ON if you have a test event, if it’s a live event, please ensure the toggle is OFF.
- Test Event Limitations:
  - Maximum 10 registrants
  - No recording capability
  - Cannot convert to on-demand viewing

More about it [here](https://help.goldcast.io/en_US/virtual-events/16616311404315-getting-started-with-goldcast-setting-up-running-an-event#test-event-12/).

#### Step 6: Marketo Program Management

If the Marketo program cloning feature worked correctly, Goldcast will have created a new Marketo program based on your Goldcast event within the `Templates - Goldcast Webcasts` folder or within whichever folder the program template lives in Marketo.

The name given to the new Marketo program will match the Goldcast event, plus a timestamp.

Rename the Marketo program to fit the regular naming convention (e.g., `YYYYMMDD_EventName_Webcast_Goldcast_template`) and move the program to the appropriate folder for the FY/quarter within Marketo.

_Note: Renaming doesn't affect sync or Goldcast event_

### Event Creation in Marketo

#### Step 1: Program Setup

1. Duplicate the template labeled for the event type
2. Move to appropriate quarter folder
3. Follow standard naming convention

#### Step 2: Get Program ID

1. Navigate to your program in Marketo
2. Find Program ID in URL: classic/ME**00000**A1
3. Copy the number between the letters (e.g., 24014)

#### Step 3: Goldcast Event Creation

1. Create event in Goldcast
2. Template Selection: Choose `GitLab Primary Template (w/o Marketo program creation)`

 _Note: This option not available for localized templates_
 With a Marketo program created before the Goldcast event, there is no need to have Goldcast create a new Marketo program.

#### Step 4: Connect Programs

1. In Goldcast, navigate to your event
2. Go to: **Integrations** → **Marketo** → **Settings**
3. Enter Program ID in `Connected Program ID field`
4. Click **Connect**

#### Step 5: Confirmation

Once connected, Marketo program tokens will automatically populate, confirming successful integration.

### Different scenarios

| Scenario | Recommended Method | Template Choice |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
|   Simple workflow, want auto-creation    |   Goldcast First    | GitLab Primary Template (auto-Marketo), GitLab Roundtable Template (auto-Marketo) or GitLab Workshop Template - (auto-Marketo program creation)  |
|   Need custom Marketo setup first |  Marketo First  | GitLab Primary Template (w/o Marketo) |
| Localized event | Goldcast First | Localized Template |
| Dry runs/Testing | Goldcast First | GitLab Primary Template (auto-Marketo), GitLab Roundtable Template (auto-Marketo) or GitLab Workshop Template - (auto-Marketo program creation) |

### Important Notes

- Program ID Changes: Renaming Marketo programs doesn't affect the Goldcast sync
- Token Population: Occurs automatically once programs are connected
- RTMP Feature: The RTMP type is a feature that allows embedding to or from external tools and there are currently no plans to use this feature. Please ping MktgOps if there is a request to try it

## Program Member Status Processing

When the Goldcast event and Marketo program are connected, Goldcast will automatically change the program status for all members without the need for a smart campaign. However, processing smart campaigns are still needed for other data appending requirements:

### Smart campaigns for Marketo landing page based registration

- `01a Marketo Form Registration`: This smart campaign **must** be active for Marketo LP registrations. Without this smart campaign, registrants will not be added to the Goldcast event and will not receive a registration confirmation email. Once the event is over, turn this smart campaign off
- `01c Marketo Form Fill Waitlist`: If registration has maxed out for the event, deactivate the `Registration` smart campaign and turn this one on to add regsitrants to the waitlist
- `01e Waitlist to Registered`: If you plan to change registrants who are currently listed as `Waitlisted` to `Registered`, turn this smart campaign on first. It refreshes the `Interesting Moment` and calls the Goldcast webhook

### Additional smart campaigns

- `02 Goldcast Form Registration and Live`: Goldcast automatically changes program statuses when events and Marketo programs are connected. This smart campaign watches for program status changes for `Attended`, `No Show`, `Canceled`, `Rejected`, `Waitlisted` and `Registered`. If the event's registration is started on a Goldcast landing page, this smart campaign needs to be turned on immediately and before invite emails are sent out to invitees. This smart campaign needs to be active before the event, regardless of registration landing page location. The flow can safely be set to automatically expire 24 hours after the event ends
- `03 Goldcast Processing - On Demand - Goldcast/Pathfactory`: This smart campaign is designed to process `on-demand` attendees based on either Goldcast post-event viewing, On-demand form fills or Pathfactory viewing. The flow needs to be turned on within 30 minutes of the webcast ending to work correctly for Goldcast on-demand attendees but is not required to be on prior to the event's end and likely should not be activated until then. Have Pathfactory keywords in-mind or ready so those filters can be added to the trigger and the flow can be activated before the 35 minute mark post-event. For the flow to work on landing pages for on-demand form fills, the Marketo landing page form needs to be switched to `FORM 2076: On-demand Webcast`
- `04 Goldcast Processing - Follow Up Requested`: If an attendee clicks the CTA button -which by default is labeled as `Talk to an Expert`- in either an Event or in a Booth, this flow marks those leads as the `Follow Up Requested` program status. In order for this flow to work, it must be active and needs to have the event ID place in the trigger filter. Otherwise the CTA button will not MQL the lead for follow up. CTA click numbers are also available to reference in the Goldcast event analytics dashboard. Note that the CTA button simply links to the "talk to sales" page during `on demand` events and on the registration landing page - and this flow does not need to be activated for `on demand`. It is up to the discretion of the team member to turn off this functionality within the Goldcast event by hiding all `CTA` buttons. The Marketo smart campaign can safely be set to automatically expire 24 hours after the event ends

 Note: Speaker information automatically populates on landing pages once loaded into the event.

_Call to Action (CTA)_

- By default, we have added a CTA button “Talk to an Expert” to all our templates that are synced to Marketo. The button is available on the stage. Once attendees click on the button, they will see a pop-up message confirming their click. We have a custom trigger in place to notify relevant team members about CTA button clicks. More about CTA button [here](https://help.goldcast.io/en_US/engagement-tools/how-to-customize-the-call-to-action-cta-button).

![Goldcast Edit Event2](/images/marketing/marketing-operations/goldcast/goldcast_edit_event2.png)

#### Program Menu for Events

**Agenda Management**

Under the Program menu, the `Agenda` controls the event's session times. When adding or removing sessions, the times and dates must adhere to the original window given during event creation. If the window needs to be changed, that can be done in the `Edit Event` menu. For events that require a `pre-recorded` video to be played followed by a `live` broadcast, such as a Q&A, it's recommended to include 2 sessions for each broadcast, appropriately labeled for the broadcast type. Notice the `Settings` button on the right: Keep `Session Redirection Strategy` set to `Automatic` for the easiest transitions between sessions.

More about setting up Agenda [here](https://help.goldcast.io/en_US/program-agenda/16629312472987-setting-up-your-event-agenda).

_Breaks_

It's also possible to add [breaks](https://help.goldcast.io/en_US/program-agenda/16629312472987-setting-up-your-event-agenda#breaks-18) between sessions. During the breaks between session times or when nothing is playing on the stage, the audience will see the asset loaded in as the buffer video. Note the template comes pre-made with a 3 second buffer video but this can be swapped out.

**Speakers**

To add a new speaker, click on `New Speaker` button on the right side and paste an email address.

**Staff (Producers and Coordinators)**

To add a new staff member, click on `New Staff` button on the right side and paste an email address.

**Rooms**

Enable `Rooms` to allow the audience to socialize across rooms during the event. Enable appropriate settings for your audience Rooms.

More about Rooms [here](https://help.goldcast.io/en_US/rooms-booths).

**Booths**

Enable `Booths` to let the audience explore themed GitLab content or sponsored content.

More about Booths [here](https://help.goldcast.io/en_US/rooms-booths).

### Best Practices & Recommendations

_Dry Run Tips_

- Each speaker needs different magic link for a dry run event (please do not use real event magic links)
- Meet in Zoom first, then enter your Goldcast DRY RUN event, but shut down Zoom once in Goldcast
- Practice going on/off stage, muting/unmuting, screen sharing
- Test slide sharing, video sharing, polls, surveys
- Practice stage layout changes, chat messages, Q&A tabs

_Pre-Event Preparation (Real Event)_

- Be backstage at least 10 minutes before session start time to confirm last minute things with your team
- Test microphone, camera, speaker, virtual backgrounds, and screen sharing during tech check
- Set up polls, surveys, and Q&A moderation settings should be already done

_During the Event_

- Join from a noise-free environment with a good headset for audio clarity
- Ensure stable, fast internet connection
- Remember that speakers must join the live stage - audiences won't see them automatically
- Always click `Leave Stage` when finished - attendees can see speakers even after session ends
- Keep an eye on Backstage Chat messages for internal updates/questions

## How to quickly set up a [DRY RUN] Goldcast event

Instead of building dry run events from scratch using templates, you can efficiently create dry run events by duplicating your fully configured real event.

_Note:_ This process is only applicable if your actual Goldcast event is already complete (assets, speakers, event title, description, and all needed settings are added).

### Step-by-Step Process

Step 1: Complete your real event set up

- Finish all event configuration (speakers, assets, slides, settings)
- Verify all uploads and integrations are working
- Ensure event is ready for production

Step 2: Duplicate your Event

_Event_

In the Events list, click the event you’d like to duplicate. This brings you to the Event dashboard > `Edit Event` > Scroll down and click the `Duplicate Event` button.

![Goldcast Duplicate Button](/images/marketing/marketing-operations/goldcast/goldcast_duplicate_event.png)

_Webinar_

In the Events list, click the webinar you’d like to duplicate. This brings you to the Webinar Dashboard > Edit Event` > Scroll down and click the `Duplicate Event` button.

Step 3: Modify for Dry Run

- Choose Workspace, enter your Event Title, Select the start time, date, and timezone of the event.

![Goldcast Edit Duplicated Event](/images/marketing/marketing-operations/goldcast/goldcas_duplicateevent_edit.png)

_Heads up:_ use the checkboxes to select if you want to copy speakers, send invites etc.

![Goldcast Checkboxes](/images/marketing/marketing-operations/goldcast/goldcast_checkboxes.png)

**Note: To differentiate your DRY RUN from real events in Goldcast, please add a [DRY RUN] prefix to the event title.**

- Date/Time: Update to your dry run date and time
- Event Type: Toggle "Test event" ON
- Registration Limit: Test event becomes non-test event at **10 registrants**. [More info](https://help.goldcast.io/en_US/event-settings/what-is-a-test-event-how-to-create-one/).

Step 4: Verification Checklist

- All assets and slides copied properly
- Magic links generated for dry run event
- You do not have more than 9 users in your DRY RUN event

More about duplicating events or webinars [here](https://help.goldcast.io/en_US/event-settings/16634914050203-duplicating-events).

#### Important notes

Please note that when you duplicate your event, some information is NOT duplicated

- Date, Time, and Timezone (You set the date, time, and time zone when duplicating an event)
- List of Registrants (When duplicating an event, people who registered for the original event are not automatically registered for your duplicated event. You can duplicate your event and create a dry run even if you already have registrants for your real event.)
- By default, the session redirection strategy is set to Automatic for all duplicated events
- Settings and Activities (like Marketo integration - meaning when you create a duplicated event, it will not create a Marketo program automatically)

What will be duplicated?

- Agenda
- Speakers (Please note that you can choose not to copy speakers over by disabling the Copy Speakers checkbox in the Duplicate Event pop up message.)
- Assets (slides, videos, polls, surveys, resources)
- Engagement settings (Q&A settings, etc.)
- Event branding, including look & feel settings
- Email settings
- Rooms and booths

## On-Demand Settings

An on-demand Stage template is pre-made and included on all webcast events. Check over the settings on all events before the event airs and know the standard URL for on-demand access normally reads: `webcasts.gitlab.com/on-demand{event-id}`. The primary toggle to check is related to `Downloadable Resources`, which is off by default

## Webcasts Subdomain

Goldcast hosts a list of its hosted webcasts under the subdomain https://webcasts.gitlab.com/. Future iterations will add to this functionality

## Rescheduling and Canceling Events

### Rescheduling Process

#### Step 1: Update Event Date/Time in Goldcast

- Select the `Edit Event` menu

![Goldcast Edit Event Button](/images/marketing/marketing-operations/goldcast/goldcast_editevent.png)

- Change the date and time to the new desired time

![Goldcast Date and Time](/images/marketing/marketing-operations/goldcast/goldcast_dateandtime.png)

- When prompted about sending an email to registrants, exit the alert **WITHOUT sending** the email (the automatic email is unbranded and only includes a calendar invite)

#### Step 2: Send Custom Rescheduling Email

- In the main event menu, select `Email` menu
- Select Send `Custom Email`
- Fill in the `Email Subject` with appropriate title
- Select the pre-made template: `[Reschedule] Default GitLab Template`
- Complete the email send by clicking `Send to Registrants`

![Goldcast Reschedule Email](/images/marketing/marketing-operations/goldcast/goldcast_rescheduleemail.png)

#### Step 3: Update Marketo Program

- Change the Marketo program name to match the new date

### Cancellation Process

#### Step 1: Send Cancellation Email FIRST

1. In the main event menu, select Email menu
2. Select Send Custom Email
3. Fill in the Email Subject with appropriate title
4. Select the pre-made template: [Cancellation] Default GitLab Template
5. Complete the email send by clicking Send to Registrants

#### Step 2: Delete Event in Goldcast

- Once the email has been deployed, the Delete Event button can be found at the bottom of the Edit Event menu

![Goldcast Delete Event](/images/marketing/marketing-operations/goldcast/goldcast_deleteevent.png)

#### Step 3: Handle Marketo Program

- Ping in the #mktgops slack channel to have the Marketo program deleted, or delete the program yourself if you have the permissions

### Important Notes

- **Never use** the automatic Goldcast rescheduling email - it's unbranded and unprofessional
- **Always send** the custom GitLab-branded email templates instead
- For cancellations, send the email **BEFORE** deleting the event to ensure registrants are notified

## Localized Event Templates

To simplify the process of creating new events, we have created 9 branded templates that are available to everyone with Goldcast Teams access. 8 of the 9 templates will auto-create a Marketo program, while 1 template "GitLab Primary Template (w/o Marketo program creation)" will not create a Marketo program and must be used for tests or dry runs only.

### How to access templates in Goldcast

1. Open Goldcast page: https://admin.goldcast.io/home
2. Click on the Templates tab on the left side

### Available Languages

By default, English is set as the primary language in the primary event template unless labeled otherwise. Captions and subtitles are also toggled on by default, but will only work correctly if the presenters are speaking in the set primary language.

Goldcast has been outfitted with localized and branded event templates for 7 additional languages:

- Spanish (Spain)
- French
- German
- Portuguese
- Italian
- Japanese
- Korean

Note that each of these localized templates will auto-create a Marketo program, bringing the total number of templates available in Goldcast to 9.

### Template Configuration

Each template has the **Primary Language** set to the listed language, meaning email assets, UI, and features are set to this language. _In order for some features (subtitles, captions) to work correctly, the speakers must be speaking in that language._ Event information must also be input by staff to match the language for a completely localized experience.

The primary language for your event is shown in the Features section on the dashboard.

![Goldcast Features Section](/images/marketing/marketing-operations/goldcast/goldcast_featureddashboard.png)

### Attendee Language Experience

Event attendees can view the Goldcast UI in any of the previously mentioned languages by changing it in their profile dropdown. When an attendee selects another language:

- Event content you customize (session names, booth/room names, resources, polls) will remain in the primary language of your event
- Navigation bar, buttons, and prompts will appear in the attendee's preferred language

### Email Coordination

#### Speaker Emails

When adding speakers to an event, the Speaker Invite/Instructions email will be set to the Primary Language initially but can beswitched to a standard English template in the Email Schedule section of the event.

If you would like to send a Primary Language email to one speaker and the standard English email to a different speaker, switch the Speaker Invite/Instructions email before adding one speaker or the other.

Important notes:

- Goldcast cannot send two different language emails simultaneously
- For the 1 hour reminder email, only one of the two emails can be sent due to those reminders being sent simultaneously
- Staff emails are only available in English

#### Japanese Templates

All Japanese event templates have been updated with email templates that include the greeting {{last name}}-sama, whether the email is in Japanese or English.

### Reschedule and Cancellation Emails

To send a reschedule or cancellation email, follow a similar protocol as explained above. Select the templates titled:

- `[Reschedule] Default GitLab Template - {{Primary Language}}`
- `[Cancellation] Default GitLab Template - {{Primary Language}}`

Depending on the email type, fill in the subject line with one of these translations:

**English templates**:

- a. "Your event has been rescheduled!"
- b. "Due to unforeseen circumstances, the event has been canceled."

**Translations by language**:

_Spanish_

- a. “Su evento se reprogramó.”
- b. “Debido a circunstancias imprevistas, el evento se canceló.”

_French_

- a. “Votre événement a été reprogrammé!”
- b. “En raison de circonstances imprévues, l’événement a été annulé.”

_German_

- a. “Dein Event wurde verschoben.”
- b. “Aufgrund unvorhergesehener Umstände wurde das Event abgesagt.”

_Portuguese_

- a. “Seu evento foi reagendado!”
- b. “evido a imprevistos, o evento foi cancelado."

_Italian_

- a. “Il tuo evento è stato riprogrammato.”
- b. “A causa di circostanze impreviste, l’evento è stato annullato.”

_Japanese_

- a. “イベントのスケジュールが変更されました！”
- b. “予期せぬ事情により、イベントは中止となりました。”

_Korean_

- a. “이벤트 일정이 변경되었습니다!”
- b. “예기치 못한 상황으로 인해 이벤트가 취소되었습니다. 불편을 끼쳐드려 죄송합니다.”

## Working with a Series

A Series in Goldcast acts as a method of grouping multiple events and webinars with differing dates and times under a single label (no restrictions on number or type of events). A Series allows attendees to register for multiple related events using a single form, rather than filling out separate registration forms for each event.

### Series Creation Process

#### How to Create a Series

- In  Goldcast Studio, click the `+` icon in the top right
- Select `New Series`

![Goldcast New Series](/images/marketing/marketing-operations/goldcast/goldcast_newseries.png)

- Name your Series and provide description
- Click `Create`
- Assign to GitLab Inc Team Workspace

#### Adding Events to a Series

- From Series dashboard, click `+Add Event` or `+Add Webinar`

![Goldcast Add Events](/images/marketing/marketing-operations/goldcast/goldcast_add_events_webinars.png)

- Create the event/webinar as usual with standard event setup
- Any event/webinar added to a series inherits the registration form from the series
- Each unique event/webinar created within the Series will create **its own** Marketo program

#### Series Templates and Limitations

- The only Series template created is currently in English: `Series Landing Page Template`
- To recreate this template, use the "duplicate" feature in Edit Series menu
**Note**: The form for the landing page is not set up at this time
- Series templates are **NOT** available - only individual event/webinar templates are supported

_Series Limitations_

- Cannot add previously created events/webinars to a series - only newly created or duplicated events
- Series **CANNOT** have a Primary Language set (function exists at Event/Webinar level)
- Different events within your Series can be set to different Primary Languages

#### Registration and Landing Page Strategy

- Series can have their own Goldcast landing page for date/time selection. Use of these landing pages is currently limited while team investigates Bizible touchpoints integration
- Recommended approach: Continue using Marketo or About.GitLab marketing landing pages until Goldcast and Bizible are correctly connected
- Contact MktgOps to set up single form registration within Marketo for series

#### Emails

- Registration confirmation and reminder emails come from individual events/webinars
- It is possible for Series to send Registration confirmation and Waitlist emails
- Staff emails are English only regardless of event Primary Language settings

#### Marketo Integration for Series

- Each event/webinar within a Series creates separate Marketo program
- Series-level Marketo integration still under investigation
- Follow standard Marketo integration process for each individual event

#### Integration and Analytics Considerations

_Current Status_

- Series integrations with Marketo should be set up BEFORE adding events
- Cross-series analytics and reporting capabilities available in Goldcast
- Bizible Integration: More information to be added after Bizible touchpoints are successfully integrated with Goldcast

_Best Practice_

- Set up series integrations before adding new events to the series
- Monitor individual event performance within series
- Coordinate with MktgOps for complex series registration workflow

### Brand Kit

All generated content uses what is called a "brand kit," which directs all generated assets to fit GitLab's branding. The following are brand guidelines that can be set within [Brand Kit](https://help.goldcast.io/en_US/brand-kit-settings/23455342212891-how-to-add-elements-to-your-brand-kit):

- [**Voice Profile**](https://help.goldcast.io/en_US/brand-kit-settings/add-voice-profile): An AI narrator, which can be set to have a specific style of speech. We can either add Brand Guidelines (including a description of our voice and tone, a PDF with a maximum size limit of 30 MB) or we can paste sample copy that represents our voice and tone (maximum permitted character limit: 10,000 characters).
- **Color**: The GitLab shades of purple (`#7759c2`) and orange (`#fc6d26`) have been pre-selected.
- **Font**: GitLab's branded font has been pre-loaded.
- **Template background**: Clips will feature one of the images loaded here. To start, 3 have been pre-loaded, and if more are desired, please open an issue with the Branding team.
- **Intro/Outro Video**: Short branded intro/outro videos to use at the beginning and end of our clips. We do not have any pre-loaded options there.

All generated content made within Content Lab can be exported for use outside of the platform.

### Video editing

You can edit your video recordings within Content Lab without downloading and uploading recordings or using any other 3rd party tools for editing. In order to make any changes, you need to open your existing video or event recording, and navigate to the Recording tab on the left side.

#### What you can do with your videos

1. Trim your video (Adjust the timeline markers to modify the start and end points of your video)
2. Remove video segments (select the text and click the Delete button in the pop-up menu). You can easily restore the deleted segment by selecting the deleted portion in the transcript and clicking "Restore" in the pop-up menu.
3. Add templates (more about [Templates](https://help.goldcast.io/video-editing/23461102108315-how-to-create-and-use-templates))
4. Change video layout (Available options: 16:9; 1:1; 9:16)
5. Customize captions (you can turn them on/off, change position, and also customize caption style)
6. Add background
7. Add an intro and outro
8. Correct captions
9. Hide in captions (This only hides words/text in the captions, but it isn't removed from the video)

#### What else you can do with videos in Goldcast

- You can automatically chapterize your videos to segment long-form videos into well-defined sections. You can manually create new chapters, delete AI-generated chapters, or rename them.
- You can delete dead space (any part of a recording where there is silence, no movement, or irrelevant content) from your recordings.
- Goldcast supports video transcription and editing for French, German, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, and Dutch languages. Please note that videos must be recorded or uploaded in one of the languages above.

## Regional Marketing Vision

As the Regional Marketing team, we are uniquely positioned to partner with the sales and ecosystem teams to execute on company objectives in local markets, driving awareness and understanding of GitLab’s benefits with integrated activities – including in-person and digital experiences – that source, generate, and progress pipeline, and accelerate adoption.

### Owned Virtual Events

For more information regarding the various owned virtual events the team runs, please visit the [**Regional Marketing Owned Virtual Events**](/handbook/marketing/field-marketing/field-marketing-owned-virtual-events/) page.

### Executive Roundtables

Executive Roundtables can be run virtually or in-person, and be organized through a third party vendor or GitLab. These events differ from webcasts/events mainly due to the size of the audience and the interactivity level. A roundtable is run as an open discussion between the host (usually 3rd party vendor), GitLab presenter and the audience. The host would open with an introduction of themselves and the topic for the session, then introduce the GitLab presenter and have them give an overview of GitLab followed by the host asking questions directly to specific people in the audience for them to openly answer and discuss. The advantage of a roundtable is that you can document the meeting more closely and understand more about an organization's pains and problems.

Below are best practices when running a roundtable:

- Content creation - FMM to work with Sales Managers to decide on most relevant or hot topics in the region
- Speaker request - Put through a Product and Solution Marketing Support Request and fill out the template
- [Example of scripts](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iy7AreiMM7seZM_EidixqdUw-OG__-cnl6pihqH72eY/edit#heading=h.btpndxf36cvl) for host and GitLab presenter
- [Example of meeting notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T2m3Izn66u9xuWGDHmR5_YJcWdUhKupfVlWVPjWGLL0/edit) to document conversations during the session
- Ensure questions are prepared between host and GitLab presenter beforehand to lead the conversations within the session
- Assign notes of each delegate to list leads for upload onto SFDC
- Pre-analysis of delegates - check to see if their organization is currently a user of GitLab, whether they're CE or EE customers. This could be a great way to start or dig into deeper conversations with the delegate.
- Ensure you have familiarised yourself with the [White Glove Event Follow Up process](/handbook/marketing/sales-development/#white-glove-event-follow-up-sequences) for this type of event.

### Third Party Events

We will sponsor regional third party events in an effort to build the GitLab brand and also to gather leads. Different types of third party events include, but are not limited to:

- AWS Summits
- Gartner conferences
- City run technology meetings
- Customer/prospect run DevOps events on invite

### Sweepstakes

Please follow the legal team's process [here](/handbook/legal/process-for-a-conference-sweepstakes/) for contests and sweepstakes requests.

### Executive Meetings

#### SLA for Executive Meetings

The SLA for executive meetings is at least 120 in advance of the conference start date. This allows time to confirm executive support, set up the scheduling process, and give Sales enough time to schedule meetings before the event.

#### Executive meetings at conferences run by Corporate Events

This occurs when the Corporate Events team sponsors a large conference and requests that Regional Marketing manage scheduling the executive meetings during the event (in a separate meeting room). The Marketing Operations team will set up the main conference Marketo program and SFDC campaign for the Corporate Events team. The FMC will set up the executive meetings Marketo program and SFDC campaign. The FMC will then nest the Marketo program in the folder that was created by Marketing Ops, and add the SFDC campaign as a child campaign to the parent campaign created by Marketing Ops. Executive meetings do not have their own campaign type and they are categorized as a [conference](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/campaigns-and-programs/#conference), so the FMC will make sure the conference campaign type is indicated in Allocadia and the FMM will utilize the conference progression statuses for the lead list. The overall conference is owned by the Corporate Events team, but Regional Marketing owns the executive meetings.

##### Setup

Once the program tracking task is completed in Asana for the main conference by the Marketing Ops team, that will trigger a task to be assigned to the AMER Regional Marketing Director to begin the executive meeting planning process utilizing [this Executive Meetings Asana template](https://app.asana.com/0/project-templates/1210812724499350/list).

#### Executive meetings at conferences run by Regional Marketing

This occurs when the Regional Marketing team sponsors a large conference and obtains a separate meeting room to run executive meetings. The FMC will set up the Marketo program and SFDC campaign for both the conference and the executive meetings.  Executive meetings does not have its own campaign type and is categorized as a [conference](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/campaigns-and-programs/#conference), so the conference progression statuses should be utilized. Both the conference and executive meetings will be owned by Regional Marketing.

##### Setup

The Regional Marketing Manager will follow the general [Plan to WIP process](/handbook/marketing/field-marketing/#process-for-moving-events-from-plan-to-wip) for the main conference. The [Regional Marketing Asana Events template](https://app.asana.com/0/project-templates/1208622308556886/list) that is utilized during that process, includes a section for creating the [Regional Marketing Executive Meetings template](https://app.asana.com/0/project-templates/1210812724499350/list). That template will be utilized for planning the executive meetings.

#### JiffleNow

The Regional Marketing team sometimes utilizes a meeting scheduling tool called [JiffleNow](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/jifflenow/). The parameters that must be met to utilize this tool for executive meeting scheduling are listed [here](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/jifflenow/#when-to-use-jifflenow). The [Regional Marketing Executive Meetings template](https://app.asana.com/0/project-templates/1210812724499350/list) provides two options - one section for meetings planned *with* JiffleNow and one section for meetings planned *without* JiffleNow.

## Regional Marketing Campaign Types and Progression Status

Regional Marketing utilizes many of [these campaign types](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/campaigns-and-programs/#campaign-type--progression-status) and follows the specific progression statuses listed for each campaign. The various success statuses for each campaign type are utilized during the lead list upload process.

## Confidentiality in GitLab Issues and Epics

When working in GitLab issues and epics, please remember that due to GitLab's value of [Transparency](/handbook/values/#transparency), many of our issues and epics are, by default, public. The best practice is to avoid including any PII or login details in issues and epics directly. If posting details of this nature is a necessity, please remember to always make your [issue](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issues/confidential_issues.html#make-an-issue-confidential) or [epic](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/epics/manage_epics.html#make-an-epic-confidential) `Confidential` when doing so. Please also be diligent in your issues and epics regarding comments made by other team members as well. If you notice another team member has posted details that should not remain public, immediately make the [issue](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issues/confidential_issues.html#make-an-issue-confidential) or [epic](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/epics/manage_epics.html#make-an-epic-confidential) `Confidential`. Other options to allow our issues to remain public, are including PII in a spreadsheet or document posted in the issue or epic that are only accessible by certain people. If logins need to be shared, please utilize the Marketing Vault in [1Password](/handbook/security/corporate/systems/1password/).

For more information regarding confidentiality levels and compliancy, please visit [this handbook page](/handbook/communication/confidentiality-levels/).

## Helpful Links Spreadsheet

[This spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10GNnLT1-r_DV8UZQxNA6Iui4N3wm3-3GgH-VEYZi42U/edit?gid=0#gid=0) helps the team track important links for our Regional Marketing process.

## How Regional Marketing utilizes Claude

[Claude](/handbook/tools-and-tips/ai/claude/) is the GitLab-approved AI tool utilized across the company. The Regional Marketing team has integrated Claude into daily workflows across several key areas, improving overall work quality and saving significant time (an estimated 11.5 to 25.5 hours for various campaign types based on the below list, and Regional Marketing has already run over 213 events in FY26 H1). Claude even assisted in refining and organizing the following examples!

### Event Planning & Logistics

- **Venue Research**: Search and compare event venues by feeding in all event specs and having Claude research locations ([example](https://claude.ai/share/c7263ab2-1b2d-4645-a44c-d8bf006a4e17))
  - TIME SAVINGS: 1-2 hours
- **Event Timing Optimization**: Ask Claude for the best date/time for in-person events while avoiding holidays, regional large conferences, and high traffic times. Also used to find the best times to host virtual webinars, yielding maximum attendance
  - TIME SAVINGS: 30 minutes to 1 hour
- **Event Engagement**: Create short fun quiz questions to increase attendee engagement, enhance learning, foster interaction, and create memorable experiences ([example](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oWGsV-6nIEJ4psJ3a7v62qu4ywbkHvu-gwvbfbbLcfg/edit?tab=t.8n5nqsxu4dh30))
  - TIME SAVINGS: 30 minutes to 1 hour
- **Project Planning**: Build project plans with lookback date recommendations ([example](https://claude.ai/share/c7263ab2-1b2d-4645-a44c-d8bf006a4e17))
  - TIME SAVINGS: 30 minutes to 1 hour
- **Document Recreation**: Recreate documents to fit new event requirements (example of turning [this old sponsorship agreement](https://claude.ai/share/c7263ab2-1b2d-4645-a44c-d8bf006a4e17) into a new agreement by providing Claude with the original template and the new sponsorship prospectus)
  - TIME SAVINGS: 1-2 hours

### Data Analysis & List Management

- **Lead List Cleaning**: Clean lead lists where entries need adjustments to formatting, removing junk data, etc. ([Asana project](https://app.asana.com/1/306855239930259/project/1209517412144204/overview/1209517533381809)) - MOps is working on one large Claude prompt for all lead lists
  - TIME SAVINGS: Depending on the size of the list (30 leads versus 1,000 leads) anywhere from 30 minutes to 2 hours
- **Tableau Analysis**: Evaluate reporting for better visibility into ROI and generate strategic insights for implementing company initiatives into regional event tactics
  - TIME SAVINGS: 1-2 hours
- **Data Transformation**: Create Markdown files of Tableau data ([example](https://claude.ai/share/9f71d4b8-2f9b-496e-8de0-80915021304d)) to transfer to Google Sheets for easier filtering and analysis
  - TIME SAVINGS: 30 minutes to 1 hour
- **Registration List Extraction**: In EMEA, conferences typically don't provide registration lists before events. While networking portals show all registrants, they're only accessible to registered pass holders and don't allow list exports. Save networking portal pages as PDFs, feed them into Claude, and automatically generate a clean registration list for the team to review ([example](https://claude.ai/share/c7263ab2-1b2d-4645-a44c-d8bf006a4e17)). Claude can also create a Markdown file of the data to transfer to Google Sheets for easier filtering and note documentation.
  - TIME SAVINGS: 30 minutes
- **Customer Feedback Consolidation**: Gather various feedback docs, notes, and survey results from AWS Summits and other activities, consolidate the information, identify common themes, and provide actionable recommendations for improvements. Claude can also create graphs and slides for visual representations (note: elements can't be easily edited as in Google Slides or PowerPoint)
  - TIME SAVINGS: 30 minutes to 1 hour

### Content Creation & Communication

- **Event Asset Copy**: Generate and refine copy for event materials, as well as general spelling and grammar checks
  - TIME SAVINGS: 30 minutes to 1 hour
- **Translation Support**: Translate messages and conversations between GitLab and partners, and create first drafts of external communications (to be validated with a native speaker)
  - TIME SAVINGS: 30 minutes to 1 hour
- **Personalized Outreach**: Craft email sequences for AE outreach that highlight specific pain points and what attendees will gain from each event
  - TIME SAVINGS: 30 minutes to 1 hour

### Strategic Intelligence & Research

- **Meeting Analysis**: Analyze meeting and offsite notes to extract key insights and action items ([example](https://claude.ai/share/70a93c4c-06d5-4b6f-9c6e-200844c747b4))
  - TIME SAVINGS: 30 minutes
- **Account Research**: Conduct comprehensive account research using SA team methodologies ([example](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xVzH7SLn6WigEkjoY1i94CkPk6bjyC1Am120Ve9SfB8/edit?slide=id.g358e5761807_0_1359#slide=id.g358e5761807_0_1359))
  - TIME SAVINGS: 1-2 hours
- **Tradeshow Research**: Perform high-level tradeshow research by analyzing the potential customer audience based on event website information ([example](https://claude.ai/share/c7263ab2-1b2d-4645-a44c-d8bf006a4e17)) to share with field and partner sales teams for initial event review
  - TIME SAVINGS: 30 minutes to 1 hour
- **Product Knowledge**: Develop battle cards comparing GitLab to competitors, highlighting unique differentiators in the DevSecOps space
  - TIME SAVINGS: 30 minutes to 1 hour
- **Executive Roundtable Research** Use Claude to pull specific information for executive roundtables and provide structured summaries based on company information and attendees, including:
  - Company overviews
  - Persona role analysis
  - Opinion research on roundtable topics sourced from relevant articles
  - GitLab alignment with companies' DevOps and AI strategies
  - Discussion points on data residency, AI regulations, and implementation
    - TIME SAVINGS: 30 minutes to 1 hour

### Partner Collaboration

- **Account Mapping**: When a partner provides a list of companies they're planning to target at a joint event, use Claude to easily map this list with the GitLab FO target account list. Provide feedback to the partner on what accounts to focus on and invite more decision-makers from these FO accounts
  - TIME SAVINGS: 30 minutes to 1 hour
- **Partner Marketing Brainstorming**: Quickly analyze a new partner's broader technology partnerships and their target industries to better understand their audience ([example](https://claude.ai/share/c7263ab2-1b2d-4645-a44c-d8bf006a4e17)). Note: Critical analysis of Claude's ideas is needed and should always be checked with ESM and AE teams for accuracy
  - TIME SAVINGS: 30 minutes to 1 hour

## PathFactory

Via our Marketing Operations team, Regional Marketers can request Author Role access to PathFactory to upload and curate assets into tracks that are then disseminated for use in Marketo, about.gitlab.com, and other campaign-related channels. Regional Marketing currently has Reporter level access. To view the difference in user roles, head over to the [PathFactory page](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/pathfactory/#access).

### The Benefits of having Author Role Access

1. Efficiency gains: It takes more time to create a request issue for the Campaigns Team and wait for the request to be processed than it takes to upload an asset or create the track yourself.
1. Ownership: Having author role access to PathFactory will allow Regional Marketing to have control on asset uploads and content tracks to ultimately personalise the PathFactory experience according to region, country and target accounts.
1. Optimization: Viewing each asset/track's performance can help Regional Marketing refine and optimize the content with monthly or quarterly refreshes.

### Getting Started

Visit the [user role](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/pathfactory/#user-roles) section of the PathFactory page to learn more about the author role.

### Required Training

Please review the [Pathfactory Training](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/pathfactory/#training) videos (specifically the author role training) before submitting an AR to request author role access.

This section will continue to be fleshed out as we rollout to the global Regional Marketing team.

## Asana

The global Regional Marketing team has worked closely with the Marketing Operations team to implement [Asana](https://asana.com/) as our new project management tool.

### Asana Handbook Pages

- [External Asana Page](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/asana/)
- [Internal Asana Page](https://internal.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/marketing-ops-and-analytics/marketing-operations/asana/)

### Asana Marketing Calendar

Please visit the internal handbook page [here](https://internal.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/marketing-ops-and-analytics/marketing-operations/asana/#fy26-marketing-calendar) for links to our Asana Marketing Calendar that highlights upcoming events and details.

### Asana tips and best practices

1. If you do not need a task, please delete all subtasks and then the task itself. This will remove the task from the view of everyone involved and is less confusing. Changing the task status can be overwritten by the rules we have set in place, so it’s better to delete if you aren’t using it. Examples of tasks that should be deleted if you are not using them: Build Landing Page, Email tasks, Build Target List.
1. Do not make any changes to or delete the “Host Live Event” task (or the task that just has the name of the event on it). This is used for the SSOT Marketing Calendar. It will auto-populate, no action required on your part.
1. When you complete a task that is assigned to you, please be sure to click “Mark Complete”. You can find the “Mark Complete” button at the top of the task. We have several rules to automate the task status field, but they depend on tasks being marked complete when they are done to move to the next step of the workflow.
1. You have subtasks on emails called “Email approved by DRI” and on landing pages called “Landing page approved by DRI”. If you approve the sample/page, please be sure to click “Approve” on these tasks. This will record your approval and trigger the next step in the workflow (push live, schedule to send, etc).
1. If you copy new Email tasks from the template, please be sure to change the subtasks from “(template)” to the email number (as well as the main task). This will help avoid confusion in notifications and on My Tasks.
1. We have added boards for MOps and Lifecycle to track their tasks. Relevant subtasks for these teams will be automatically added to the respective projects upon project creation. **If you create a new task** (or subtask, in the case of emails, landing pages, etc) after the project is created, please be sure to add the MOps subtasks to: `OP - Marketing Operations Support` and the Lifecycle subtasks to: `Lifecycle Marketing - Email Approvals`.

## Process for moving events from Plan to WIP

The following is the process for when a Regional Marketing event moves from the draft/plan phase to becoming finalized and actively managed in Asana (WIP).

### SLAs

Please plan your timelines accordingly based on the below SLAs. Keep in mind these SLAs must also include additional time for any Friends & Family Days or holidays.

- **Contract Requests:** 3 business days for the FMC to enter into ZIP
- **Plan to WIP** - 3 business days for the FMC to complete, once the FMM completes the `FMC Checklist` and `Ecosystem Involvement` tasks in the Asana project
- **Marketing Operations Requests** - [7 business days](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/campaign-operations/#slas)

### Moving from Plan to WIP

*Please note that this is an interim process while the Regional Marketing team begins utilizing [Asana](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/asana/). Automations are still being implemented, so there will be many iterations to the below instructions as all global teams move to Asana.*

#### Step-by-Step

- FMM pings the FMC in the main Regional Marketing issue and requests the FMC create the Asana project
  - **NOTE:** The FMM will not fill out any additional information in the GitLab issue. All work will be managed in the [Asana](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/asana/) project.
- FMC reviews the Allocadia sub-category and line item panel details, as well as checks that the forecasted cost is in the correct month (according to the [prepaid policy](/handbook/finance/accounting/#prepaid-expense-policy)) for the tactic and makes any changes necessary
  - FMC to make sure the correct FMM and FMC are listed in the Allocadia panel for the event. The team members listed in Allocadia will sync to the GitLab issue and then to the Asana project (Asana tasks will be assigned based on these roles as well).
- FMC creates a new project in Asana by following the below steps:
  - FMC adds the `Asana-Sync-Project` label to the GitLab issue. Adding this label will trigger the Asana project to be created utilizing the GitLab > Asana sync.
    - In Asana, please give the system a couple of minutes to pull all of the details through. You receive a notification when the Asana project has been created.
    - The BT Bot will also comment in the GitLab issue that the Asana project has been created and will provide the project link.
- When the Asana project is created, the project will also be automatically added to the [FY26 Asana Marketing Calendar](https://app.asana.com/0/1209020056902315/1209020173960870).
- FMC to fill in any Event Details that did not sync from the GitLab issue
- FMC reviews the list of tasks and adjusts any past due tasks accordingly. If new dates are not available yet, please remove both the due date and task owner until they are available to add back in. If this step is not taken, other team members will receive notifications about tasks being past due, which will lead to confusion. Please keep your projects as updated and current as possible!
- FMC then pings the FMM in the GitLab issue that the event has been moved to Asana and is ready for the FMM to work through their tasks in Asana

#### Important Notes for FMMs

- The FMM must fill in and `complete` the `FMC Checklist` task before the FMC will be notified to move the project to WIP.
- Please always hit the `complete` button for each task, once the task is finished. We have many dependencies built into our Asana template and if you do not `complete` a task, the next steps will not be triggered for other team members.
- For more information on how the event asset process runs with Marketing Ops, please reference [this page](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/campaign-operations/#triage-steps).
- Please add any appropriate sub-region or country tags to your project. NOTE: The main region categories (AMER, APAC, EMEA, PubSec) will be automatically associated. Many tags are already created in Asana, please utilize these tags and do not edit any existing tags.
  - If you need a new tag created, please request your tag in this [Tag Request Form](https://form.asana.com/?k=iROsm3N8LW4Wb8HY0PFxeQ&d=306855239930259).

#### Closing out Asana Projects

- Once the event is over, the FMM will confirm the lead list has been processed and any remaining tasks for the event have been completed. **NOTE:** You must complete or delete all open tasks in a project or they will still show up in your assigned tasks (see how to bulk complete tasks [here](https://forum.asana.com/t/closing-tasks-for-a-project-set-for-a-completed-status/282266)). The FMM will then go to the top of the page and click `Set status` and select `Complete`.

## Event Lead Collection Should-Knows

Not every regional event or lead are the same. There will be times when meeting/scanning leads and notetaking for the interaction will require a tweaked processing procedure. A few examples are below:

`High Priority` leads: There are situations where GitLab leadership wants extra attention placed toward a prospective lead/account, assuming the right criteria is met for that lead/account. These leads are referred to as `High Priority` and utilize the `high priority` process. This label not only means its namesake, but it also means the lead will circumvent our normal lead routing and MQL processes to be sent immediately to SDR/BDR for strategic outreach. There are a few reasons why a lead would be marked as `High Priority`, but for this particular handbook page there are two primary definitions to focus on:

- **High Priority Campaign**: This lead was acquired during a `high priority` event. While strategizing for the quarter and year, Sales and Marketing leadership discuss what upcoming regional events will be important based on GitLab's current and future goals. If a regional event is determined to fit the criteria, all leads collected from this event will be marked as `high priority` and quickly routed for follow up. Leadership will communicate what campaigns qualify
- **White Glove**: A white glove lead needs strategic outreach and will involve the [SDR, Account Executive and maybe more](/handbook/marketing/sales-development/#white-glove-event-follow-up-sequences). Generally, these leads were highly engaged in conversation about GitLab, have detailed event notes about the engagement and or were engaged with specific GitLab team members during the event. White glove leads can exist within a high priority campaign, so use best judgement on which label is most appropriate between the two

 Recording `high priority` status for either of these types is simple and included in the spreadsheet used for [self-service list uploads](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/automated-list-import/#data-cleaning-instructions) under the `High Priority Reasons?` column - as a dropdown option. The reason feeds into Marketo's `High Priority Reason temp` field, which [then processes](https://engage-ab.marketo.com/?munchkinId=194-VVC-221#/classic/SC56504A1ZN19) the lead for early lead routing.

### Post event lead flow for each campaign

After Regional Marketing has executed a campaign, the Regional Marketing Manager is responsible for ensuring that the campaign has been fully operational to include the following:

- The campaign DRI reviews and cleans up the list following the guidelines for [list imports](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/list-import/)
- SDRs should not be asked to follow up leads before they are added to Salesforce
- If a follow-up email was to go out to all attendees and no-shows, the FMM is responsible for ensuring that emails were sent.
- Did the campaign respondents receive the correct amount of MQL points they should have received the activity they participated in?
  - Person scores are available for viewing in our `Custom Links` section of each SFDC campaign. This allows you to view the MQL score of the campaign members, whether they be a lead or contact, all within one view.
- Did a lead/contact hit our MQL threshold and have the SDRs followed up with this record and moved them beyond the [MQL stage](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/)?
- Update all the relevant tabs in the regional marketing campaign event planning sheet.

### Adding SFDC Campaigns to Leads for Attribution

For instructions on how to add a SFDC campaign to a lead for attribution, please watch this two minute [instructional video](https://youtu.be/IYzkR3h4Ajo) (you must be signed into GitLab Unfiltered to view).

### SFDC and Sales Alignment

To help with reporting within SFDC, each Regional Marketing Manager is assigned the accounts based on SAE/AE assignment. Regional Marketing has decided to align with the SAE/AE vs. 100% geo focused in an effort to foster collaboration.

Routing for geo reps is done through zip codes worldwide. Named accounts and the US Public Sector are manually handled differently. Sales Ops will run monthly audits to update PubSec and Named accounts. Regional Marketing management works with Sales Ops to keep this information up to date.

Should you come across an account you believe should be owned (or perhaps NOT owned by you) please follow these steps:

1. Within the account in SFDC, please chatter @sales-support and provide reason why this account should be updated
1. If more than 10 accounts need updated or if a FMM changes regions, then please open a [sales ops issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/sales-team/field-operations/sales-operations/-/issues/new?issuable_template=General%20Request) requesting the update be made.

Complete details on how GitLab Sales handles rules of Account Engagement can be [found here](https://internal.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/go-to-market/rules-of-engagement/).

## ROI and Reporting

Regional Marketing utilizes [Tableau](/handbook/enterprise-data/platform/tableau/) for analytics and reporting on events and campaign tactics.

In addition to Tableau, we also utilize numerous saved reports in SFDC under the Regional Marketing folder [here](https://gitlab.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Folder/00l61000000GAAtAAO/view?queryScope=userFolders).

## Rescheduling or Canceling Events

### Rescheduling or Canceling a Webcast or Virtual Workshop

Please note that the process for rescheduling or canceling a webcast or virtual workshop involves additional steps. For details regarding these instructions, please see below.

Please see process [here](/handbook/marketing/field-marketing/field-marketing-owned-virtual-events/#rescheduling-a-workshop-or-webcast) for rescheduling and [here](/handbook/marketing/field-marketing/field-marketing-owned-virtual-events/#canceling-a-workshop-or-webcast) for canceling.

For all other event types (including in-person workshops), please see instructions below.

### Rescheduling Events

#### FMM Tasks

- FMM to ping the FMC and staff/DRIs in the Asana project to communicate the updated date(s).
- FMM to obtain an addendum/updated contract from the venue with the new date(s) (if applicable). The FMM will then re-open the original contract request and ping the FMC with new date(s) and addendum/updated contract.

### Process to Close Marketo Landing Pages and Landing Page Forms

#### Marketo Asset Expiration

Please follow the instructions found on the [campaigns and programs](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/campaigns-and-programs/#asset-expiration-use-cases) handbook page to set expirations on program assets during program set up.

#### Options for Closing LPs and LP Forms

There are two options for closing Marketo landing pages:

1. Closing the LP registration form (which removes the registration form from the LP so registrations can no longer be accepted) and updating the LP to explain why the registration form is no longer available (either the event has reached capacity or the event has occurred).
2. Closing the entire LP. If someone clicks on the LP link, it will take them to our about.gitlab.com page instead of a registration LP. This option is now done automatically during the [Marketo Asset Expiration process](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/campaigns-and-programs/#asset-expiration-use-cases). Asset expiration occurs 4 weeks after the event date, so it is important to close the registration form and update the LP verbiage once an event reaches capacity or has occurred so the LP does not remain open and active during this time.

The FMC will track all open Marketo LPs and will be responsible for requesting the LP form be closed by Marketing Ops once the event occurs or if an event reaches capacity.

To close the LP registration form, the FMC will re-open the Marketo LP issue and request Marketing Ops follow one of the below processes (depending on campaign type, as Marketo program templates vary across different tactics). In the LP issue, the FMC will request Marketing Ops remove the registration form and will provide Marketing Ops specific verbiage for the top of the LP page. Please see standard verbiage options below. If the event is a workshop that was listed on the demo/workshop page, the FMC will also request Marketing Ops remove the listing. The FMC will update the due date of the issue.

#### If an event has reached capacity

- The FMC will follow the above instructions to close the LP registration form and update the verbiage to specify the event has reached capacity.
- If there are remaining invite issues open once registration is closed, the FMC will note this in the issue(s) and close them. If an invite is already scheduled to be sent, the FMC will ask Marketing Ops to unschedule the send before closing the issue. The FMC will update the due date of the issue.
- If a LinkedIn campaign was run, the FMC will request the ABM team close the LinkedIn registration form in their ABM issue.
- There is no need to remove the event listing from the [Events Page](/handbook/marketing/digital-experience/decap-cms/#events) if an event has reached capacity. Having a sold out event listed could create more excitement over the event and encourage future attendees to register for events sooner.

#### Standard verbiage for closing a Marketo LP after the event has occurred

*The below verbiage can be utilized/sent to Marketing Ops when closing a Marketo LP form after an event has occurred.*

Thank you for your interest in this [insert event type]. This event has concluded and registration is now closed, but GitLab has a number of hands-on events and educational programs scheduled at any given time. Please visit our [events page](https://about.gitlab.com/events/) for more information on upcoming events and dates.

#### Standard verbiage for closing a Marketo LP if an event is at capacity

*The below verbiage can be utilized/sent to Marketing Ops when closing a Marketo LP form if an event is at capacity.*

Thank you for your interest in this [insert event type]. The event has reached capacity and registration is now closed, but GitLab has a number of hands-on events and educational programs scheduled at any given time. Please visit our [events page](https://about.gitlab.com/events/) for more information on upcoming events and dates.

#### Closing a Marketo LP Form

These instructions explain how to close a Marketo LP form and how to update the LPs verbiage at the top of the page. The page and the information on it will still be visible to visitors, but there will no longer be a form to fill out for registration.

#### Closing a Webcast Marketo LP Form

See instructions [here](/handbook/marketing/field-marketing/field-marketing-owned-virtual-events/#closing-a-webcast-landing-page).

#### Closing a Workshop Marketo LP Form

See instructions [here](/handbook/marketing/field-marketing/field-marketing-owned-virtual-events/#instructions-for-closing-registration-for-a-workshop).

#### Closing a Marketo LP

These instructions are standard across all campaign types and will close down the entire LP and re-routes visitors to our about.gitlab.com page. If you have set up [asset expiration](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/campaigns-and-programs/#asset-expiration-use-cases) previously, this step will occur automatically.

- Sign into Marketo
- Click into the Marketo program for the landing page you wish to close
- Click into `Assets`
- Click `Registration Landing Page`
- At the top of the page click `Landing Page Actions`
- In the drop down list click `Unapprove`
- Click the orange `Unapprove` button in the pop up box
- Go to your landing page URL and make sure the landing page is no longer active (the site that should pop up is `about.gitlab.com`)
- Go to the `01a or 01b Registration Flow and deactivate the smart campaign`

#### Adding a Registrant after Marketo LP Reg Form is Closed

If you have closed a Marketo LP registration form because your event has reached capacity but need to add in an important registrant after the fact, please follow the below instructions.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Regional Marketing does not have access for the below actions. Please ping Marketing Operations in the `#mktgops` Slack channel to add registrants when needed.

Important context: The landing page and form themselves have no bearing on whether or not someone is synced. The sync relies solely on `Program Members` and their statuses. Thus, a person can fill out a form, but if their program member status is never updated to `Registered`, they will never sync over into the webcast in Zoom. Likewise, we can update someone's status to `Registered` without any form every being filled out, and they will still sucessfully sync to Zoom.

1. Navigate to the `Database` tab in Marketo
1. In the quick find box, type in the person's email and click the magnifying glass to search (If they do not exist, click `NEW` in the upper ribbon and add a `new person`. It will take up to 10 minutes for them to then show in the lead database)
1. It will take you to a screen with everyone matching your query. Once you find the correct person, click them to highlight.
1. Once highlighted, you can right click or select `Person Actions` from the upper ribbon
1. Hover over `Programs` and click on `Change Program Status...`
1. Search for the program you want to add them to (it should be the main program, not an invite send, etc) and select the status of `Registered`
     - Check how many people this will affect. It should just be 1 (or the number you highlighted)
1. Click `RUN NOW` to execute the action
1. A status box will appear on the top right and tell you when the action finishes processing
     - Once added as `Registered` scoring will trigger for the registrant
     - Once the registrant is synced to zoom (within 30 min or so), the registrant will receive a confirmation email automatically from Zoom.

You can use these steps to add anyone to a Marketo program.

## Registration Problems on a GitLab Landing Page

If a registrant is having issues registering for an event on a GitLab landing page, please have them first try the below fixes. If these still do not work, open a [bug issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/marketing-operations/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/bug_request.md?_gl=1%2a1652726%2a_ga%2aMTg4MDU0MzY5Ni4xNjAxMTI2MTEw%2a_ga_ENFH3X7M5Y%2aMTY2NzU3MzczMi4xNTAuMS4xNjY3NTc3MDQyLjAuMC4w) with Marketing Ops to help determine if there is a problem with the landing page.

- Ask what browser they are utilizing and if there are any plugins potentially blocking the registration page.
- If they have not already, have them try registering utilizing Chrome.
- Have them try registering using Incognito Mode.

## Adding and Removing Workshop Postings on the Regional Workshop Demo Pages

We market our workshops on both the [GitLab events page](https://about.gitlab.com/events/) and via the below EMEA regional workshop/demo page (the AMER and APAC demo pages have been deprecated). The GitLab events page listings require an MR to add new events (see instructions [here](/handbook/marketing/events/#how-to-add-events-to-aboutgitlabcomevents)) and events will automatically drop off the page once the event date passes. But the regional workshop/demo pages require manual adjustment. When an EMEA workshop LP is created by Marketing Ops, they will add to the EMEA workshop/demo page once the LP is approved. When the workshop is completed and the FMC requests that Marketing Ops closes the LP, Marketing Ops will also remove the listing from the regional workshop/demo page.

- [EMEA Workshop/Demo Page](https://page.gitlab.com/technical-demo-series-emea.html)

### Regional Workshop Demo Pages - Instructions for Marketing Ops

Marketing Ops will add EMEA workshops only to the [EMEA Tech Demos and Workshop page](https://engage-ab.marketo.com/?munchkinId=194-VVC-221#/landingpage/16146).

For more information regarding the regional workshop/demo pages, please visit [this handbook page](/handbook/marketing/virtual-events/webcasts/#technical-demo-landing-pages).

## Tactics that Involve Customer PII

There are times that Regional Marketing will run campaigns that involve building a landing page in Marketo in order to collect addresses for shipping swag. Examples of these instances are a 5k run, GitLab-hosted tasting event, direct mail campaigns, etc. When collecting addresses, please follow the below instructions for ensuring PII compliancy.

### Landing Page Verbiage

When collecting addresses on our Marketo landing pages, make sure to always include the following verbiage on the page - `By giving us your address, you are giving us permission to mail items to your home or office. We will not use this data for any other purposes.`

### Pulling Addresses for Swag Sends

Please note that due to PII compliancy, addresses collected in Marketo landing pages are not synced to SFDC. As a result, Marketing Ops support is required to pull the address list from Marketo (Regional Marketing does not have this level of access in Marketo).

### Removing PII from Marketo

Once the report is downloaded (or the event/tactic has ended and all swag has been sent), Marketing Ops will then also delete the PII information directly in Marketo. To request this support, please review [this page](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/marketo/#list-exports) and open an [export request issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/marketing-operations/-/issues/new?issuable_template=export_request) to specify when a list pull and PII deletion is needed. Also remember to delete PII from any order spreadsheets once swag has shipped.

### PII Compliancy Timeline

Please remember to delete all customer PII within 90 days of an event (inlcuding lead list spreadsheets).

Example - You ship swag in August for an August event. Our August monthly invoice processes in September, so those August shipping charges should be forecasted in September.
- Item quantities are listed in the portal. Please select from the current items in stock for your event. If you need a larger quantity of an item over what is available, you intend to utilize the remaining stock for an item, or you are ordering over 500 pieces of an item, please reach out to `@krogel` for reordering.
- Please be aware that ordering newly designed swag or placing reorders for existing items requires adequate lead time. Time frames vary greatly based on the items selected, design approval, and availability. General Lead Times: 6-8 weeks to produce a new item and 2-3 weeks to reorder current designs

Please coordinate with our Regional Marketing PubSec team with regards to swag cost limits.

#### Event Assets

Event assets utilized for shows (including backwalls, tablecloths, popup banners, event kits, etc.) are stocked at the Brilliant warehouse and can be ordered for events using the [Brilliant store portal](https://app.brilliantmade.com/users/sign_in). It is also recommended that each Field Marketer keep a separate GitLab tablecloth, popup banner and table runner with them at home for easy access and to be utilized for events.

#### Returning Event Assets and Swag

It is the FMM's responsibility to not only ship assets to events, but to also ensure the onsite event DRI ships the items back within **3 days** of the end of the event.

The FMM is to make sure the onsite event DRI is aware of the location of the return shipping labels and of their responsibility to ship the items back.

**PLEASE NOTE:** Trash and items not stored in the Brilliant warehouse should not be put in the return shipping boxes (this includes stickers, please see [below](/handbook/marketing/field-marketing/#stickers) for more sticker information). All event assets are to be folded neatly and packed up cleanly and securely in their original boxes. All tool kit items should be returned to the tool kits for future event use. Please do not send small numbers of swag back to the warehouse if the items were bundled, only send full bundles back to the warehouse for restock. Example: If pens come in bundles of ten, please do not send back 2 pens as these cannot be re-bundled. Feel free to keep small quantities of extra swag to give out to customers, if appropriate.

[Group Management](https://corporate.grubhub.com/resource/creating-a-group/)

Before you [create a Meal Credit](https://corporate.grubhub.com/resource/meal-credits/), make sure that you have created a Group to associate with that credit.

**Note**: `Employees` in the Grubhub portal refer to our registrants for an event.

1. Log into corporate.grubhub.com. In the top right corner, click the person icon and select Business Account.
2. In the navigation bar, hover over Employees & Groups and click "Groups".
3. Here, you can manage all your Groups. Select Add new group.
4. Give your new Group a name (event name) and description, then click Add group.
5. Now, assign employees to that Group. Employees must first be added to your account before they can be assigned to a Group.
    - If you already have employees added to your account, click Add employees and select the employees you want to add to this Group.
    - If you don't already have employees added to your account, hover over Employees & Groups in the navigation bar and click Employees. You can manually add employees one by one with the "Add New Employee" button, or [bulk add employees](https://corporate.grubhub.com/resource/admin-portal/uploading-employees-in-bulk/).
        - It is important to note that when bulk-adding employees you must include the name of the group in the upload file where applicable. This ensures the employees are assigned to a group.
6. Now you can [create your meal credits](https://corporate.grubhub.com/resource/meal-credits/).
7. FMC to bulk remove registrant information once the event has concluded and the invoice has been received (all invoices are sent to FMCs on a monthly cadence).

##### Creating Meal Credits

<details markdown=1>

<summary><b>Expand below to see details regarding Creating Meal Credits</b></summary>

 [Creating Meal Credits](https://corporate.grubhub.com/resource/meal-credits/)

Before you create a Meal Credit, make sure that you have [created a Group to associate with that credit](https://corporate.grubhub.com/resource/creating-a-group/) (details above).

**Note**: `Employees` in the Grubhub portal refer to our registrants for an event.

1. Hover over "Meal credit settings" and click "Meal credits". Then, click "Add meal credit".
2. Name your meal credit; this is what your employees will see. We suggest including the name of the event or company associated with this meal credit so it's easy for your employees to identify.
3. Choose how long this budget is available.
    - One-day budgets are best for single-day events (e.g. happy hours, meetings, celebrations). They can also repeat on specific days of the week.
    - Weekly budgets are best for ongoing meal programs (e.g. providing employees lunch for the week). They can also repeat on a weekly basis.
4. Then, select the time window for when the order must be placed and delivered, or simply check the "All day" box. Orders can be placed in advance but must be delivered within the designated timeframe.
5. Next, choose what geographic areas your employees can order from. To ensure they can order from their home, select "Anywhere".
6. Under "Order Settings", you can choose how your employees order their meals. Checking all options provides the most flexibility.
7. Next, choose to require any sort of expense code/comments at checkout.
8. Lastly, we recommend notifying your employees when their meal credit becomes available. We'll send a customized, one-time email the morning their meal credit begins – so long as you create and assign meal credits the night before. Diners added to an existing budget will receive an email the morning after they're added.
9. Now, click "Add Meal Credit" and you can start adding groups to your new meal credit.
10. Scroll down to select the group(s) you want associated with this meal credit and enter the budget amount.
11. Click "Save" and you're done!

**SLA:** Please start working with legal as early as possible, but a quarter in advance is preferred.

#### Events where partners are NOT paying sponsorship fees

- Review past agreements for an understanding of what will be included and what details legal will require to build out the agreeement. (example agreement [in this comment](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/legal-and-compliance/-/issues/2177#note_2032851900))
- Open an issue in the GitLab Legal project under the [Contract Review template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/legal-and-compliance/-/issues/new?description_template=contract-review) ([example past issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/legal-and-compliance/-/issues/2177)) and specify the following details:

  - Partner name(s)
  - Sponsorship fee amount or what the partner is providing (example - office space)
  - Lead sharing specifics

- FMM/FMC to obtain partner signature on stamped agreement or provide any redlines or partner concerns questions back to the GitLab legal team
- Once the partner has signed the agreement, FMM/FMC to ping `@RendiMiller` in the issue for GitLab signature
- FMM/FMC to send the partner the fully executed agreement

#### Events where partners ARE paying sponsorship fees

- Please follow the steps [above](/handbook/marketing/field-marketing/#events-where-partners-are-not-paying-sponsorship-fees)
- Create a Billing issue in the [GitLab Finance project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/Finance-Division/finance/-/issues) ([example here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/Finance-Division/finance/-/issues/6709)) to request an invoice be created for the partner(s) and include the following details:

  - Assign `@shorton77` and `@KingaPolgardi`

### GitLab Company Information (Including Tax ID)

[Useful Company Information](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/Finance-Division/finance/-/wikis/company-information)

### Regional Marketing Contract Requests

In Regional Marketing, the FMCs manage all [Zip requisitions](/handbook/business-technology/enterprise-applications/guides/zip-guide) for their regions. For contracts or invoices ready to submit for approval, the FMM will utilize the Contract Request task in the Asana project and follow the instructions to provide important details required.

#### SLAs

The SLA for your FMC to submit your request to Zip/Coupa is **3 business days** from when they are assigned the contract request task. Please keep in mind it generally takes a week+ to obtain all approvals and/or signatures during the procurement process (longer for more complicated contracts that may require redlines from legal), so please plan accordingly.

#### Document Review

Please make sure you have reviewed your document carefully and have pre-filled the contract details required in the agreement *before* completing your contract request task in Asana. Below are some items to keep in mind when both the FMMs and FMCs are reviewing contracts...

- Correct [GitLab entity](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/Finance-Division/finance/-/wikis/company-information) that needs to be utilized, along with the correct address associated with that entity
- GitLab company name spelled correctly (capital L!)
- Lead specifics - What contact information will be provided and when?
- Correct event dates, cost, and sponsorship level
- Clear vendor goals and if the vendor fails to deliver against T&Cs/goals, a detailed make-good clause
- If a room block is involved, accurate attrition requirements have been included

#### Month Close

Please Note: AP typically closes out the month by the third business day **before** the last day of the month (Day -3). Once AP closes the month, any charges under $5k (under $50k for swag/shipping) occurring via a credit card or invoice approvals will be reconciled the following month. The month close date will be announced each month in the `#allocadia_mktg-budget-holders` Slack channel and will also be added to the [Marketing Finance Dates Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=c_j581mpq4tcn6bjojs1bqnl4eg0%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FDenver).

#### Prepaid Policy

Please make sure you have reviewed our company's [prepaid policy](/handbook/finance/accounting/#prepaid-expense-policy) and have forecasted your cost(s) correctly in Allocadia.

#### Signature Authority

GitLab team members DO NOT have signature authority. This means that FMMs are not allowed to sign any legal documents pertaining to quotes, orders, contracts, BEOs, etc. If you have a document that requires a signature, please submit it in a contract request to your FMC to process through procurement.

#### BEOs/Event Orders

Per the above, we do not have signature authority for any legal/formal document. Please request the vendor provide the final BEOs/event orders (if required) as early as possible. The FMM will submit the document to the FMC in the contract request task. The FMC will then open the existing ZIP for the original contract/agreement, ping the legal and procurement POC, and submit the BEO for signature with an explanation that this is simply the summary of the event and final numbers for approval. The FMC will also specify when the BEO is due to the vendor, so procurement is aware of the turnaround time.

#### Certificate of Insurance (COI)

Our standard COI runs from October 1 to September 30 of the following year. Our current COI can be found [in this gdrive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1swllrjk5rHUSdXKAyVT3UPEhAyHy2Sz0). GitLab's legal team works with our broker to renew our policy each year and a new COI will be available towards the end of September. Some venues will ask for our standard COI as proof of insurance, in which case, you can send our current COI to them with no changes. However, some venues require we add certain vendors as insurers to the standard COI. In this case, please follow the below instructions.

- Please email our broker at `GitLabcertrequests@lockton.com`
- Include the insurance clause (copied or a screenshot of the clause from the contract) that states what the vendor requires in the COI
- Once the broker provides the customized COI, please send to the vendor. Note that the adjusted COI can only be utilized for that particular event.

#### Coupa Card Versus Navan Card

This template is to be utilized for all contracts/orders/invoices that either require a signature/acceptance of terms and conditions and/or are over $5,000 in cost. If your order does not require a contract/signature and is under $5,000, you may utilize your [Navan credit card](/handbook/finance/accounts-payable/corp-credit-cards/) for payment.

#### Swag

Please do NOT use your Navan card for any type of swag purchases. Only a Coupa card or invoice payment through the procurement process is allowed for swag purchases of any kind.

#### Coupa Card Limits

Please be aware that your Coupa card limit is directly associated to the approved PO amount. We have a 10% overage on the card and if you try to charge more than 10% over the PO amount, the card will decline. If you require additional funds be added to the card limit, you will need to request your FMC submit a [PO Change Request](/handbook/business-technology/enterprise-applications/guides/zip-guide/#how-to-do-a-request-change) to increase the PO total and the card limit.

#### Coupa Card Max (Onboarding New Vendors)

Please also note, we can only use Coupa cards for POs up to $25,000. Anything over $25,000 requires ACH payment and onboarding the vendor through Zip/Coupa. If you know you have an upcoming contract/payment over $25,000, please contact your FMC in advance so they can check to see if the vendor is currently in Zip/Coupa and if not, they can request the vendor be onboarded in advance by submitting a [Zip request](/handbook/business-technology/enterprise-applications/guides/zip-guide/#how-to-request-a-new-vendor). No contract is required to submit this request and an estimated cost can be provided. Please note in the title of the submission that the request is for new vendor onboarding only. For any questions, please reach out to your FMC.

#### Various Charges on Coupa Card

If you are submitting various charges for approval on a Coupa virtual card, please make sure you either provide the PDF contract/order/quote or, if ordering through an online portal, please include a screenshot of the items you need to order. Each separate order requires a supporting PDF or screenshot that shows the vendor name, items being ordered, and total cost. These requests will be reviewed during the procurement process and if approved, the Coupa card issued will cover all costs submitted. Only one Allocadia line item is required per Coupa card approved. For example, if you submit a contract request for booth, AV, and IT charges for a show that equal $3,000, you only need one Allocadia line item ID for all three charges and your plan/forecast number would equal $3,000.

PLEASE NOTE: These charges follow the [prepaid policy](/handbook/finance/accounting/#prepaid-expense-policy) and you will always reference the total cost of the charges/PO amount for determining the prepaid threshold. For example, if you submit a $3,000 AV order and a $3,000 booth items order together on one PO, the total PO amount is $6,000. Even though each charge is under the $5k prepaid threshold, the total amount of the PO is $6,000, so you would forecast the charges under the month the event occurs.

#### Multi-Event Contracts

We often receive a discount for multiple events and the vendor includes all events under one contract. When this occurs, the FMM will need to create an Allocadia sub-issue and line item for each event and provide all of the Allocadia IDs in the contract request for the FMC. The FMC will submit the contract in ZIP and add separate lines for each event with that specific event's information and Allocadia ID.

PLEASE NOTE: These charges follow the [prepaid policy](/handbook/finance/accounting/#prepaid-expense-policy) and you will always reference the total cost of the charges/PO amount for determining the prepaid threshold. For example, if you submit a contract for 3 events and each event costs $3,000, the total PO amount is $9,000. Even though each event is under the $5k prepaid threshold, the total amount of the PO is $9,000, so you would forecast each event charge under the month the event occurs.

#### F&B/AV/Additional Event Charges

Since we often don't have the exact headcount for an event in advance, additional costs (such as AV, F&B, etc.) can be estimated for initial procurement approval. If your additional costs are included in the initial venue contract, please ask the venue to provide pricing for your estimated headcount in the contract (especially for F&B costs, so that you are not only submitting your F&B minimum). This will give us a baseline cost estimate for approval and your FMC will adjust the PO amount as needed, based on final cost (a PO change request will be issued for charges above 10% over the original PO amount). If your additional costs (catering, AV, etc.) are being provided by different vendors from the venue, please make sure you have separate Allocadia line items for those charges and also submit separate contract requests (if a contract is required by the vendors). If the vendor does not require a contract and charges are under $5,000, you can pay with your Navan card.

### Sourcing New Vendors

Regional marketers are always looking for new ways to support the sales teams within their regions and to provide unique, alternative ways to draw potential prospects closer to our company and show value to our current customers in order to expand within those accounts. Regional marketers have a vast tool kit of marketing initiatives for precisely that. However, sometimes a gap is identified and regional marketers will look to external third party vendors to help fill that gap when it comes to achieving their goals to their marketing metrics.

When souring and selecting a new third-party vendor, there are a few things that should be considered:

1. What are you trying to achieve? What is the gap you have identified? Is it filling the top of the funnel? Building relationships within a specific target audience (i.e. C-Level)? Maybe your goal is delivering on more qualified leads? Be clear on your end goal(s) from the beginning.
1. Can this vendor achieve your goal? Have the vendor show you proven use cases and references on your specific goals.
1. Have you sourced more than 1 vendor? A good point of reference is to research at least 2 or 3.
1. Is this vendor willing to proceed with a pilot program with you? Even with the best intentions, not all 3rd party vendors will fulfill your needs as originally discussed. A pilot program will allow you to try out the vendor and/or their product without requiring a full investment up front.
1. Identify all of the pieces of the contract. Ensure that you and the 3rd party vendor are aligned on the following:
    - Cost
    - Timeline of project
    - Timeline of onboarding
    - What is required when it comes to integration - Full Access, No Access or Partial Access
    - What are your deliverables?
    - What are their deliverables?
    - Identify who needs to be trained. What does that training involve?
    - Who will be the DRI for the project (always have 1 person who will support you during your contract process)?
    - What is the cost of renewal, or, if you are running a pilot, what is the cost of a full term contract?
    - If you're running a pilot, what are the goals you have in place to determine if you should invest beyond the pilot phase?

Once you feel confident that you have chosen the right 3rd party vendor, now is the time to begin the following review process.

#### Working with Brand New Vendors

New vendors are popping up frequently and in the spirit of iteration and testing, the Regional Marketing team at time may want to engage with a vendor that is brand new to the space (remember, at one point in time way back in 2011, GitLab the company was brand new too!). You should work with your leader to assess these opportunities. To ensure we are protecting our own company, you should follow these steps when working with a brand new vendor:

1. If contacted via social media or other manner by an unknown individual and/or individual(s) related to an event, review all event/program materials, including a detailed review of the organizers website to confirm past events. In addition, review various social media materials.
1. If an event is unknown, new or first time, the Team Member can engage with Alliance and Channel Team Members to gather feedback on the events organizer and ensure value, use your netowrk internally and ask around if folks know this vendor.

- Where applicable, request details and documentation related to previous event(s) hosted by the organizer.
- In situations where an organizer is hosting an inaugural event, Team Members can ask for other partners / sponsors who are participating, and receive direct confirmation from the event space host (e.g, hotel).
- In situations with first events, the regional marketing team can engage the GitLab Legal Team for additional review.
- [Video walk through](https://youtu.be/Ao-HUl15c1A) with our legal team outlining this process can be found on GitLab Unfiltered.

## Out of Office Process

We follow the processes documented in the [Communicating your time off section](/handbook/people-group/time-off-and-absence/time-off-types/) of our handbook page. Please follow the below instructions.

1. WORKDAY: Add your OOO to [Workday](/handbook/people-group/time-off-and-absence/time-off-types/)
1. COVERAGE: Notify both your manager and the person covering for you that you will be out of the office. Make sure the person covering for you has all important details needed while you are away.
1. GMAIL: Add an OOO message for your email. Please ensure you include the contact information of the person covering for you.
1. ASANA: Go to your Asana settings and toggle on `Set Out of Office` and fill in OOO dates. Then, go to the `About Me` section and specify the dates you are OOO and who can be contacted as your backup support for any reviews, approvals, etc.
1. GOOGLE CALENDAR: Turn on [Google Calendar's out of office setting](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/7638168?hl=en) (scroll down to "Show when you're out of office") to create an out of office event that will automatically decline new and existing meetings for you. Or, please ensure to manually cancel/decline/reschedule any meetings if you will not be in attendance.
1. SLACK: When you submit your OOO through Workday, an OOO notification will automatically be added to your Slack the days you are out. If you're traveling for an event and not necessarily on PTO/vacation, please ensure you are manually updating your Slack status accordingly. If your time off was added in Workday, Time off by Deel in Slack will also prompt you to add a delegate who will be covering for you. Please fill in this information so it's clear in Slack who people can contact in your absense.
1. GITLAB: Add an OOO to your GitLab profile and mark yourself as `busy`
1. ZIP: If you work in ZIP, please assign a delegate by going to ZIP - Settings - Personal Settings - Out of Office
1. COUPA: If you work in Coupa, please [assign a delegate in Coupa](/handbook/business-technology/enterprise-applications/guides/coupa-guide/#how-to-add-a-delegate-in-coupa) so you will not hold approvals while you're enjoying your time off.
1. MDF: If you are an MDF approver, please see handbook details [here](/handbook/marketing/channel-marketing/#pto-process-for-mdf-request-approvers).

## Our Team

Global Channel Marketing team is a team of professionals whose job is to build marketing plans to grow the channel business worldwide. We think about our Channel Marketing program in terms of marketing to the channel partners, marketing through the channel partners, and marketing with the channel partners.

## Marketing to the Channel

This team is responsible for the development of channel marketing campaigns that leverage GitLab's go-to-market campaigns.  We work with partners to help them understand what the campaigns are, how to use them to help drive partner sourced opportunities, how to leverage upcoming GitLab webinars/webcasts to drive conversion and how to generate trials for GitLab that they can nurture with prospects. Part of this program includes a Partner Leadership Summit, which is an in-person event meant to connect our channel partner leadership & GitLab direct leadership to share the GitLab vision and the important part our channel partners play in the success of our business.

## Marketing through the Channel

The Global Channel marketing team provides support to partners by creating different campaign assets into leverageable go-to-market programs called Instant Campaigns that partners can easily pick up and run with their customer or prospect lists.  GitLab channel marketing is also responsible for the development, rollout and management of trial enablement programs by which partners can generate trials of GitLab directly from their website, and passing or providing trial leads generated from GitLab's own website to be worked and converted by partners.

Our Channel Marketing Managers support the channel go-to-market efforts through our [MDF funding and management program](/handbook/resellers/channel-program-guide/mdf/) and are responsible for ensuring they are building a strategic marketing plan with our [marketing-ready partners](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/channel-marketing/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Channel_Mktg_Ready) ([up-to-date SF report of marketing-ready partners - internal](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/00OPL0000003UhV)).

### Marketing-Ready

Marketing-ready means:

1. Partner has an approved business plan with GitLab
1. Has a list of focus accounts mapped with GitLab
1. Has a joint value proposition statement with GitLab
1. Has a dedicated person who manages leads sent to the partner by GitLab (Partner Prospect Admin)
1. Acknowledges the lead passing and recall process
1. Has a dedicated marketing responsible person to work on the joint activities with GitLab
1. Has regular calls with the GitLab Channel Marketing Manager (CMM)
1. Acknowledges the [MDF Policy](/handbook/resellers/channel-program-guide/mdf/) and requirements for MDF process (requests & claims)

Channel partners are ultimately responsible for the execution of these campaigns.

## Joint Marketing with the Channel

The Channel Marketing Manager works with the Field Marketing team to identify upcoming field marketing events and activities that channel partners can participate in for joint go-to-market activities. Both the Channel Marketing Managers or the Field Marketing Managers can suggest campaigns for marketing-ready channel partner participation.

## Current Service Offerings

For an in-depth look at the programs and tools we offer our partners, see our [marketing menu of services](/handbook/marketing/channel-marketing/channel-marketing-epics/Channel-Marketing-Service-Offerings/) page.

- Working with Sales Ops and Marketing Ops improve attribution and reporting of [partner sourced leads (CQLs), and partner sourced opportunities](/handbook/sales/field-operations/channel-operations/).

## 6 Month Planning Cycle with quarterly reviews: Channel Marketing Managers

The Channel Marketing Managers are responsible for creating channel marketing plans with our marketing-ready channel partners that align to a 6-month planning cycle with quarterly reviews. This allows time for our channel partners to properly source resources and staffing for these campaigns.

- Feb - July - Plans due second week of December
- August - January - Plans due second week of June

The goal is that we eventually have our partners aligned to our planning cycle, but we realize that we need to take into account THEIR own planning cycle. Should there need to be a different planning cycle cadence to accommodate a Marketing-Ready channel partner, this should be clearly documented in the [marketing-ready issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/channel-marketing/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Channel_Mktg_Ready).

### Tactically, how do we plan?

1. The Channel Marketing Manager is responsible for identifying which of our partners are `Marketing-Ready`. This is done by the CMM completing a [marketing-ready issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/channel-marketing/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Channel_Mktg_Ready), indicating that the partner has committed resources to work with GitLab.
2. The CMM builds a strategic plan of campaigns with the Channel partner's marketing contact. The team is expected meet on as frequent of a basis as is needed to support the plan. At least bi-monthly.
3. In advance of the due date for the plans (due dates listed above), the CMM is expected to add their plan directly into [Allocadia](/handbook/marketing/strategy-performance/allocadia/). Our CMMs need to add their plan into Allocadia as this is where we track our program spend and can run reports based on the various attributes in the Allocadia details panel.
4. Each campaign run by the CMM should have a [related epic](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/channel-marketing/-/issues/new?issuable_template=MDF_Campaign ) that further details out with the specific campaign entails.
5. In advance of the quarterly scheduled QBR, which is run in alignment with Regional Marketing's QBR schedule, the CMM's will complete this [regional deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10bUd4Zdk1NmbQB_a-JT_bBE5-fnZ7xZ9mElga4kn3-8/edit#slide=id.g1287bf62b57_0_209). This deck should be shared with the regional channel sales directora as well as the partner account managers (PAMs) and partner territory managers (PTMs).
   - Communication about the campaign should happen in the epics, this Google slide deck is for the purpose of the QBR and high-level plan sharing. Allocadia,the epics and issues are the SSOT.
   - While it is our goal to avoid mid-execution timed campaigns, it is possible to submit for approval mid-planning cycle. Should that be the case, you do not need to go back into your QBR deck and add the activity.
6. On a bi-annual basis (every 6 months) our CMMs are responsible for creating a [scorecard](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MuyKcDYMeIdfIcRGSzfLgy0SmGUG8ASPrhb4W0iHxkk/edit#gid=0&range=A1) with our partners. We have this scorecard in order to align around what's mutually important to the success of both of our business and to help with goal setting for future quarters. This should be built in collaboration with the Marketing-Ready Channel partner.

### Requirements and SLAs for MDF budget approvals

1. Requirements for an MDF budget review:
   - Complete FY Partner Business Plan (provided by the Partner Account Manager/Partner Territory Manager)
   - A joint value proposition with the partner (worked out jointly with the PAM/PTM and Channel Partner)
   - A list of mapped accounts that we are targeting with this Channel Partner (provided by PAM/PTM)
   - A complete marketing ready issue and Channel Partner scorecard (completed by CMMs)
   - A complete MDF request epic with all tactic details (submitted by CMMs)
   - A strategic marketing plan with the partner (included in the partner buisiness plan by CMMs)
2. SLAs
   - All the above elements should be completed, prior to the CMM creating an MDF Request approval epic. We aim to approve the MDF budget requests within 7 working days of submission date by the CMM, however if the above requirements are missing or incomplete this time frame will be extended until all elements are received in full.
   - Once CMM obtained budget approval for the campaign, it is the Partner Program Manager's responsibility to approve the tactic in SFDC within 48 hours.
   - For easier tracking and enhanced transparency between the involved teams, the CMM is to apply due dates to MDF Request Epics.
3. Flexi-budget requests
On occasion we may consider supporting partners outside the [target markets](https://internal.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/fy25-strategy/#target-markets-and-segments). For this we can leverage 5% of the overall quarterly MDF budget for the specific region. To gain approval for these tactics:
   - The CMM opens a flexi-budget issue, [example](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/channel-marketing/-/issues/1039).
   - The justification for using funds outside the focus countries will have to be provided by the CAM
   - The Regional Director of Channel reviews and vets the request
   - Approval is granted by Regional Marketing Lead and the Global Director of Channel & Field Marketing if deemed appropriate
   - The Regional FM Lead is responsible for tracking the MDF budget spend for all flexi budget requests in the region. SLAs for approving MDF flexi-budget requests differ case by case depending on the complexity of the request.

#### Approval status of MDF campaigns

- [EMEA channel marketing board](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/marketing/-/epic_boards/48005?label_name%5B%5D=Channel%20Marketing&label_name%5B%5D=EMEA%20Channels) (GitLab internal)
- [APAC channel marketing board](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/marketing/-/epic_boards/48005?label_name%5B%5D=Channel%20Marketing&label_name%5B%5D=EMEA%20Channels) (GitLab internal)

### Team Roles and Responsibilities

- **Channel Marketing Manager (CMMs)** - Responsible for building and driving the marketing strategy with the Marketing-Ready partners, including the usage of MDF & proposing which partners are ready to run campaigns WITH the Field Marketing team. The CMMs are regionally aligned, to collaborate with PAMs and PTMs in specific geographies.

- **Field Marketing Managers (FMMs)** - The field marketing managers are responsible for articulating where we need channel partner engagement to drive demand generation plans, the FMMs collaborate directly with the regional Channel Marketing Managers to execute marketing campaigns WITH the marketing ready channel partners.

- **Partner Program Marketing Managers** - Develops scalable marketing programs to support Partners.

Once a plan for the quarter has been established it is imperative that the CMM, partner marketing contact & PAM/PTM stay in close, consistent alignment about plan execution.  If there is a plan in place where the channel partner is participating in a program WITH GitLab lead by the Field Marketing team, its the expectation that the Field Marketing team is executing this campaign jointly with the regional partner. The CMM should be involved to help communicate with and hold the channel partner accountable, as they own the marketing relationship with the partner.

## Tracking Success

GitLab Marketing receives 'credit' for opportunities that are partner-sourced so long as the opportunity has a BATP (Bizable Touchpoint) from the campaign. We also track deal registrations specifically from MDF spend. This can be tracked on our lead sharing dashboard and is detailed out in our [Marketing Strategy & Analytics handbook page, here](/handbook/marketing/strategy-performance/marketing-metrics/#channel-marketing-reporting).

## How We Communicate with Channel Partners

Channel Marketing communicates with Partners through two online platforms and via a quarterly webinar.

### Partner Flash/News On Demand

Partners who create a profile in the [GitLab Partner Portal](https://partners.gitlab.com/) are automatically included in our broad communications and marketing announcements through our Partner Flash newsletter and custom program and marketing announcements.  This is our default method of communication.  Partners may alter their preferences, such as the frequency of communications, preferred topics and declination of receiving messages, in the My Profile section of the portal.

For more information about Partner Flash/News On Demand and process to become a contributor, please see the [Ecosystem Operations Handbook Page anchor link](/handbook/sales/field-operations/channel-operations/#external-partner-support-and-communication).

## MDF Program Introduction

GitLab Marketing Ready partners have access to the proposal-based GitLab Marketing Development Funds (MDF) Program. These funds are intended to support our partners' demand generation efforts.

### MDF Investment Objectives

- Demand Generation
      - The objective of these activities is to gain net-new end-user customers for you and GitLab. Examples of eligible activities include seminars, workshops, telemarketing or email marketing campaigns, participation in tradeshows, exhibitions, and direct mail.
      - Eligible costs may include mailing costs, fulfillment items, lead qualification, distribution, venue costs, food and beverages (excluding alcoholic beverages), speakers' fees, management costs, and lead capturing costs.
      - GitLab supports a limited number of partners in the selected regions, please check your eligibility with your regional [Partner Account Manager](https://partners.gitlab.com/English/?ReturnUrl=/prm/English/c/marketing-contact-cam) and [Channel Marketing Manager](/handbook/marketing/channel-marketing/#meet-the-team).

- To be considered for funding support you must:
      - Be a Marketing Ready GitLab Partner. Marketing ready means:
         - partner has an approved business plan with GitLab
         - has a list of focus accounts mapped with GitLab
         - has a dedicated person who manages leads sent to the partner by GitLab (Partner Prospect Admin)
         - acknowledges the [lead passing and recall process](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/impartner/#partner-recall)
         - has a dedicated marketing responsible person to work on the join activities with GitLab
         - has regular calls with the GitLab Channel Marketing Manager

## Requesting MDF funds

- Marketing Ready Channel partners with marketing plans in place will submit [MDF proposals through the Partner Portal](https://partners.gitlab.com/prm/English/s/add-mdf-request), and GitLab approvers will be notified of the request through email.
  - The MDF proposal from the Regional Channel Marketing Manager
  - Once the MDF request has been either approved or declined the partner will be notified:
          - If declined, the partner will receive a notification informing that their request has been denied.
          - If approved, the MDF Operation's team will [open an issue](/handbook/marketing/channel-marketing/channel-marketing-epics/)

### PTO Process for MDF Request Approvers

Note that, when you have a planned PTO, Marketing Ops will need to add your manager as a secondary approver. Previously, you can do this in Salesforce, however, you'll need to create an issue request for support from MktgOps.

### Demand Generation activities eligible for MD

Details are listed out in the [MDF handbook](/handbook/resellers/channel-program-guide/mdf/#eligible-activities-and-required-proof-of-performance-mdf-activities).

These activities are captured as `Campaign Type Details` on the campaign level in Salesforce.com for `Partner - MDF` [Campaign Type](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/campaigns-and-programs/#campaign-type--progression-status) only.

## Requesting Swag for Channel Events and Awards

We offer Marketing Kit Swag for Marketing Ready partner, these kits consists of:

- Banner stand
- Table Cloth
- 1000 stickers
- 200 Swag items (examples would be: colorful cable set, iPhone stand, bottle opener key chain, etc)
Please work with your Channel Marketing Managers to order your Marketing Kits.

## Partner Instant Marketing Campaign

With GitLab Instant Marketing campaign assets, GitLab's Select and Open partners have access to marketing resources to help them quickly, and easily generate qualified prospects for their sales teams. We've developed turnkey, integrated partner campaigns-in-a-box, which we refer to as "Partner Instant Marketing" campaigns, so partners can simply and easily co-brand assets and execute!

These assets leverage GitLab go-to-market motions, such as DevSecOps and Automated Software Delivery, but are modified and expanded (in some cases) for partner use. Campaign assets include: nurture emails, landing pages, short videos, mini-books, social media and paid ads, quick sales guides and sales call scripts. All assets can be found on the GitLab partner portal.

Our modular campaign is designed to be a flexible, self-service model, so partners can download an entire campaign, or a couple of assets, and the materials are customizable and co-brandable. These campaigns are also available in 6 languages: English, French, German, Japanese, Korean and Spanish.

Partners and team members may review current campaigns available to partners by logging into the [Marketing Demand Generation section](https://partners.gitlab.com/prm/English/c/marketing-demand-gen) of the partner portal.

## Beyond our Team's Scope

- Custom campaigns: Channel Marketing does not currently have the resources to support individual partner campaigns and events. Please encourage your partners to leverage one of our turnkey, and integrated [Instant Marketing Campaigns](/handbook/marketing/channel-marketing/#partner-instant-marketing-campaign) available on the [Partner Portal](https://partners.gitlab.com/English/).
- Unique Partner Asset Creation: Channel Marketing is unable to work directly with partners to customize their marketing assets.
- Event speakers: The Channel Marketing team does not have the resources to help locate GitLab speakers for partner events.
- Partner Blogs: The Channel Marketing team does not have the resources to craft unique content to support a partner blog or content request.
- Public Relations: The Channel Marketing team is not responsible for editing or approving blogs or partner press releases. Please see the [Corporate Communications handbook page](/handbook/marketing/corporate-communications/#partner-requests-for-external-communications-support) for more information.
- Sponsored social media posts: partners looking to GitLab to promote partner activities would not route those requests through Channel Marketing.  Instead, CAM's obtain the partner's social media channels and [create an issue](/handbook/marketing/integrated-marketing/digital-strategy/social-marketing/admin/#open-a-new-issue-to-request-social-coverage) for the Social Media team.  This request should include the partner's social media information, detailed description of what we are being asked to promote and target dates.
- Event attendance: The Channel Marketing team does not own a database of contacts by which to drive attendance to partner specific events nor do we possess the resources to support such requests.
- [Partner training](/handbook/resellers/training/) is managed and supported by the Channel Partner Training, Certifications, and Enablement team.
- Partner portal management: [Partner portal administration from the Ecosystem Operations team](/handbook/sales/field-operations/channel-operations/#communicating-with-the-partner-teams-via-slack) is managed by GitLab Ecosystem Operations.

## Partner Marketing Campaigns

Channel and Alliance partners use the same Marketo operations process, both requiring [CRM Partner ID](/handbook/marketing/channel-marketing/#crm-partner-id) for [list imports](/handbook/marketing/channel-marketing/#list-import-for-partner-leads) and [UTM parameters](/handbook/marketing/channel-marketing/#utm-parameter-url).

Two smart campaigns filter leads by partner type:

1. **[Channel Partner](https://engage-ab.marketo.com/?munchkinId=194-VVC-221#/classic/SC32767A1)** - Populates Impartner Partner Account, suspends marketing, sets Channel workflow fields
2. **[Alliance Partner](https://engage-ab.marketo.com/?munchkinId=194-VVC-221#/classic/SC33550A1ZN19)** - Does not populate Impartner Partner Account

|                        | CRM Partner ID (For list import and form fills) | Passed to Partners via Impartner | Marketing Suspended | Lead Score | Responsible for Lead Follow Up |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------ |
| Channel Partner leads  | Yes                                             | Yes                             | Yes                 | No         | Partner                        |
| Alliance Partner leads | Yes                                             | No                              | No                  | Yes        | GitLab S/BDRs                    |

Interesting Moments automatically identify partner type:
> ALLIANCE LEAD with {{my.Partner Name}} visited Booth at {{my.event name}} on {{my.event date}}
>
> CHANNEL LEAD with {{my.Partner Name}} visited Booth at {{my.event name}} on {{my.event date}}

For Channel Partner CRM IDs critical to the lead flow, click [here](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/00O4M000004aSq6). Alliance Partner CRM IDs can be found [here](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/00O8X000008mxIb).

## Channel Campaign Setup Overview

Channel campaigns lead flows from Marketo → SFDC → Impartner via the ["Prospects" tab](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/impartner/), including MDF, Joint GitLab and Partner, and Partner Managed campaigns.

General steps:

1. Clone and update Marketo program template
2. Sync Marketo program to Salesforce
3. Import partner lead list

Partner leads are suspended from GitLab marketing and excluded from [lead scoring](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/marketo/#scoring-model) when passed to partners. Marketing communications and lead scoring resume when leads are [recalled](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/impartner/#partner-recall) when they aren't actioned after a certain period of time.

Partner leads still receive operational emails. To exclude them, add `Impartner Partner Account` equals to blank to your smart list. [Read more](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/email-management/#partners-and-email-communication).

**Note: [SSOT - ALL EMAILABLE](https://engage-ab.marketo.com/?munchkinId=194-VVC-221#/classic/SL52996261A1) excludes partner leads.**

## Partner Notifications

Partners receive automated email notifications at two key stages of the partner lead lifecycle: immediately when leads are shared with them through Impartner, and when leads approach their recall deadline after 30 days of inactivity.

### Notification Types

#### Partner Lead Notification

Partners are alerted within 24 hours when new leads are synced to their Impartner portal.

- **Campaign ID**: [34955](https://experience.adobe.com/#/@gitlab/so:194-VVC-221/marketo-engage/classic/SC34955A1ZN19)
- **Smart List**: [SL53541997 (Within 24 hours leads shared)](https://experience.adobe.com/#/@gitlab/so:194-VVC-221/marketo-engage/classic/SL53541997A1LA1)
- **Timing**: Triggered for leads shared in the previous 24-hour period

#### Lead Recall Notification  

Partners receive advance notice when leads are approaching their 30-day recall deadline due to inactivity.

- **Campaign ID**: [37430](https://experience.adobe.com/#/@gitlab/so:194-VVC-221/marketo-engage/classic/SC37430A1)
- **Smart List**: [53542010 (23rd day lead is shared)](https://experience.adobe.com/#/@gitlab/so:194-VVC-221/marketo-engage/classic/SL53542010A1LA1)
- **Timing**: Sent on day 23 after initial lead sharing (7 days before 30-day recall)

### Technical Implementation

#### Workato Integration

All partner notifications are orchestrated through Workato to ensure reliable delivery and prevent duplicate communications. Workato consolidates multiple lead notifications into single, digest-style emails sent to each partner.

#### Required Fields

The notification system depends on two critical Impartner fields:

- **Partner Synced Date**: Timestamp capturing when the lead was first synced to Impartner
- **Partner Contact Email**: Primary email address for the designated partner contact

#### Notification Logic

- **Daily Processing**: System identifies leads synced within the last 24 hours and sends consolidated notifications to respective Partner Contact Email addresses
- **Recall Timing**: On day 23 post-sync, partners receive recall reminder notifications
- **Delivery Method**: One consolidated email per partner, regardless of lead volume

## Types of Partner Campaigns

Partners have many different type of campaigns that fit into specific categories. Each campaign has it's own ROE for lead routing and email practices. See the campaign [flow chart](https://www.figma.com/file/vOe7ohMpZfYCGEG3siIpbU/Partner-%2B-GitLab-Campaign-Workflows_2023-08-28_19-18-38?type=whiteboard&t=QvcXdK9p5nlkFL2I-1) to understand how leads are distributed.

- [MDF Campaigns](/handbook/marketing/channel-marketing/#mdf-campaigns)
- [Joint Campaigns](/handbook/marketing/channel-marketing/#joint-gitlab-and-partner-campaigns)
- [Partner Sponsored Events](/handbook/marketing/channel-marketing/#partner-sponsored-events)
- [Partner Managed Campaigns](/handbook/marketing/channel-marketing/#partner-managed-campaigns)

### MDF Campaigns

[MDF campaigns](/handbook/resellers/channel-program-guide/mdf/) involve financial support or funds provided by GitLab to the Channel Partners to manage a lead generation campaign. These campaigns follow their own processes not found on the campaigns-and-programs page. Follow the [MDF Campaign handbook](/handbook/marketing/channel-marketing/mdf-operations-process/) for complete setup steps.

 🖇️ Quick Links: [Lead Routing](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/traction-lead-complete/)

### Joint GitLab and Partner Campaigns

When GitLab and Partners participate in campaigns together including events, webinars and more.

🖇️ Quick Links: [Lead Routing](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/traction-lead-complete/#joint-partner-campaign)

Use the [campaigns and programs page](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/campaigns-and-programs/#marketo-program-and-salesforce-campaign-set-up) to select and clone the appropriate Marketo template. Follow the additional instructions below to ensure data integrity for partner campaign tracking.

Update Marketo tokens `{{My.Partner Name}}` only if using token partner forms. Example:  `By registering for this GitLab and {{My.Partner Name}} event....`

#### Online Campaign - Lead Capture via Form/Landing Page

The following instructions is for joint campaign run with one partner, and must be completed prior to launch.

1. Update the Marketo tokens: `{{my.Partner Name}}` with Partner Name.
1. Update `Registration Landing Page` to use `FORM 3146: Partner + GitLab Joint Event with Token`
   - To update the page:
       - Right click `Registration Landing Page`, edit draft.
       - Under Elements, find Custom Form and double click on the form.
       - Update Edit Form Settings, select: `FORM 3146: Partner + GitLab Joint Event with Token` and click `Swap`.
       - Top right, `Landing page Action` select for the dropdown menu, then click `Approve and Close`.
1. Processing `Registration` Smart Campaign
    1. Processing smart campaign's Smart list must reference the landing page used in Program.
    2. Schedule, `Activate` smart campaign.
1. Set up asset expiration as [described here](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/campaigns-and-programs/#asset-expiration-use-cases), if needed.
1. (no setup needed) Marketo will process.
    1. If there is a `CRM Partner ID`,
        1. Set `Impartner Partner Account`
        1. Set `Partner Consent` = `True`.
1. (no setup needed) Interesting moments will dynamically change if there is a partner involved to reflect that.
1. (no setup needed) [Traction](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/traction-lead-complete/#joint-partner-campaign) picks up from there, and the lead is routed accordingly to either GitLab or the Partner in Impartner.

##### Running a Joint Campaign with Multiple Partners?

The process above will work for an event with **multiple partners** driving to it. Make sure they have their [UTM Parameter URL](/handbook/marketing/channel-marketing/#utm-parameter-url) correct when sending traffic to the registration page. You can use the `Form 2432: Partners` which doesn't require the use of tokens, and provides a generic partner consent messaging that can apply to all partners.

#### In-Person Campaign - Lead Capture via List Upload

If a form/landing page isn't available to capture registrations, see [List Import for Partner Leads](/handbook/marketing/channel-marketing/#list-import-for-partner-leads).

The process above will work for an event with multiple partners driving to it. Make sure they have the partner ID properly appended to each person on the list.

### Partner Sponsored Events

GitLab allows Channel Partners to sponsor our owned events (example - Corporate Events runs an owned event involving partner sponsors). The leads acquired by the Channel Partner will be shared regardless of their `Lead Status` and `BDR Prospecting Status` and will not be applicable to the recall process despite `Lead Source` = `Owned Event` and not `Partner Qualified Lead`.

`Lead Acquisition Source` needs to be manually updated to `Partner Sponsored Event` in the Marketo program flow. To do so, the steps below must be followed.

**Step 1**: Should there be any Partner sponsors, the Partner Marketing team specify to Marketing Operations team which campaign/program and Channel Partners are the sponsors.

**Step 2**: Marketing Ops team will need to update the program flow.

**Step 2a**: Update the smart campaign flow according to the lead creation method:

- For online lead creation via form submission, update `01b - Registration`
- For offline lead creation via list import, update `02b - Manual Upload Processing`

**Step 2b**: Update the data change value from:

 > If `Impartner Partner Account` is not empty, `Lead Acquisition Source` change value to `Owned Event`

 to

 > If `Impartner Partner Account` is empty, leave blank (Do Nothing).

**Step 2c**: Add Choice: If `Impartner Partner Account` is equal to `Account ID of the Partner Sponsor (s)`, `Lead Acquisition Source` change value to `Partner Sponsored Event`

### Partner Managed Campaigns

Partner managed campaigns are marketing activities organized and leads generated are owned by partners.

#### Partner Campaigns

Note that this type of campaign are not generated by MDF.

**Step 1: Setup in Marketo**

1. Clone the Marketo program template: [YYYYMMDD__Partner_Name_Event_Name_Region](https://engage-ab.marketo.com/?munchkinId=194-VVC-221#/classic/PG16629A1)
2. Update the Marketo tokens: `{{my.Partner Name}}` with Partner Name.

**Step 2: Sync to Salesforce Campaign**

1. In the Marketo Program Summary page, in `Salesforce Campaign Sync`, click on `Not Set`.
1. `Salesforce Campaign Sync` will pop up, with a `Campaign` dropdown, select `Create New`, then `Save`. This will automatically populate the campaign tag, so you do not need to edit anything.

**Step 3: Update Salesforce Campaign**

1. Update  `Campaign Type Details`
1. Change the  `Campaign Owner`  to your name
1. Update  `Start Date`  to the date of launch
1. Update  `End Date`  to when the campaign concludes
1. Update  `Budgeted Cost`  - If cost is $0 list 1 in the Budgeted Cost field. - NOTE there needs to be at least a 1 value here for ROI calculations, otherwise, when you divide the pipeline by 0 you will always get 0 as the pipe2spend calculation.
1. Update  `Region`  and  `Sub-region`  if you have the data available
1. Update  `Is a Channel Partner Involved?` = `Yes`
1. Update  `Channel Partner Name`
1. Click `Save`.

**Step 4: List Import**

Follow the steps in [List Import for Partner Leads](/handbook/marketing/channel-marketing/#list-import-for-partner-leads).

## Lead Sharing to non-Reseller Partner

This process applies when sharing webinar leads with co-marketing partners who are not enrolled in GitLab's partner program and therefore cannot access the standard partner portal for lead sharing.

### Required Consent Language

To ensure compliance when sharing leads with non-partner affiliates, the webinar registration form must include both of the following disclaimers:

**Disclaimer 1 (GitLab Consent):**

> I would like to receive emails from GitLab about products, services and events. GitLab will process your personal data in accordance with the GitLab Privacy Statement found at https://about.gitlab.com/privacy/.

**Disclaimer 2 (Affiliate Sharing Consent):**

> I agree to allow GitLab to share my personal data with its webinar affiliates as applicable, who may send you marketing communications in accordance with the affiliate's privacy policy.

### Data Sharing Method

**Approved Tool: Google Drive**

Process:

1. Export the lead data to an appropriate format
2. Upload the file to Google Drive
3. Share the file with only the approved recipient using specific email invitation (not link sharing)
4. Verify the recipient has successfully accessed and downloaded the file
Remove sharing access after confirmation of receipt

**Security Notes:**

- Google Drive is approved for Orange Data classification
- Use caution with sharing settings to ensure only the intended recipient has access
- Do not use public or "anyone with link" sharing options
- Unshare the file promptly after the recipient confirms they have downloaded it

<!--#### FY25 GitLab Sales Dev Working Partner Leads

As part of a [pilot program in FY25](/handbook/resellers/channel-program-guide/mdf), GitLab Sales Dev team can work on MDF campaign leads agreed upon by Partners.

We are treating these leads as non-partner leads with Source = `Partner Qualified Lead`. They will be scored, assigned to BDRs, and have LIM. The source will remain as Partner Qualified Lead as we will use this to track partner ownership, while allowing our GitLab Sales Dev team to work these leads and not lose insight into where the lead came from.

The Marketing team will use FM Marketo template to set up the campaigns, and these **MDF campaigns** will follow the **High Priority routing rules** - if the lead is part of an actively working account with BDR assigned, they are assigned to BDR, and if the lead is an MQL, then it will follow the regular lead routing rules. However, if the lead is neither Actively Working nor MQL, they will be shared with the Partner.

Note, that when a lead is already shared with a Partner, it will not go to the Sales Dev team.

##### Indicators

- Campaign - `High Priority = True AND Campaign Type = Partner - MDF`
- Lead/Contact - `Source = Partner Qualified Lead AND/OR Partner Lead Worked by Sales Dev = True`
- Opportunity - `Source = Partner Qualified Lead AND/OR Partner Lead Worked by Sales Dev = True`

##### Process

This process requires the following platforms: Allocadia, Marketo, Salesforce, Traction and Vartopia.

[Flow Chart >](https://www.figma.com/file/6LFKq2rQaw16YFhq1zej5d/Sales-Dev---Partner-Sales-Collaboration?type=whiteboard&node-id=0-1&t=GQvBSLo14kJcVzGu-0)

<iframe style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" width="800" height="450" src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Ffile%2F6LFKq2rQaw16YFhq1zej5d%2FSales-Dev---Partner-Sales-Collaboration%3Ftype%3Dwhiteboard%26node-id%3D0%253A1%26t%3Dzu4zZQVPbHpeR8S0-1" allowfullscreen></iframe>

1. Allocadia - Create the subcategory and line item in Allocadia.

   1. In the details panel, update `Worked by Sales Dev` to `True` on the subcategory (required)
   2. Open GitLab epic and issues using the GitLab issue - Allocadia integration. The GitLab epic and issues will include an issue template called, [Partner Sales Campaign - BDR Collaboration Template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/sales-development/-/blob/main/.gitlab/issue_templates/Partner_Sales_BDR_Collaboration_Template.md?ref_type=heads). The purpose of this issue is to communicate how the Sales Dev team is expected to follow up with the campaign.

2. Follow the [instructions](/handbook/marketing/channel-marketing/#types-of-partner-campaigns) to set up Marketo Program and SFDC Campaign.

   1. Setup in Marketo
      1. Clone the appropriate [FM program template](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/campaigns-and-programs/#steps-to-setup-marketo-programs-and-salesforce-campaigns)
      2. Go to the Program > My Token - Fill out the Tokens

   2. Add Allocadia Subcategory ID to Marketo Program/SFDC campaign description, then sync to Salesforce Campaign

   3. Update Salesforce Campaign
      1. Update `Is the Channel Partner Involved?` = Yes (Automated with Allocadia integration)
      2. Update `Channel Partner Name` with Partner Name (Automated with Allocadia integration)
      3. Mark campaign as `High Priority`.
      4. Campaign Type changes to `Partner - MDF` (Automated - Updated in Minutes).
      5. Sync the campaign to Vartopia so it shows in the `GitLab Marketing Campaign` field dropdown. (Automated - Every Hour).

3. Import

   1. Change the CRM Partner ID column to say Partner.
   2. Add `Partner Lead Worked by Sales Dev` = `True` column.
   3. Once imported, if the lead is net new, the source will be changed to `Partner Qualified Lead`.

4. Traction Routing

   1. Since it's a High Priority campaign, only MQLs and Actively Working Accounts will be routed to BDRs/SDRs.
   2. If the lead is not MQL nor Actively Working, then Vartopia Partner Account will be added and Lead Acquisition Source if blank =\ MDF Campaign and reassigned to the Partner Queue.
5. Marketo -  Leads that are sent back to the partner will be updated with the partner fields ie. Partner Consent, Do Not Email = Partner Lead, Marketing Suspended, etc (Automated).

<!--## Distributor Campaigns

### Carahsoft

#### Campaigns Without Leads

The purpose of this use case is to allow Value-Add campaigns to be available in the Distirbutor Marketing Campaign dropdown to track ROI, which doesn't require a lead list.

1. Carahsoft - Add the Event/Activity Name and Campaign Code to the [Carahsoft Marketing Plan spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12HTBd4wye-G-Ep6-WKFQ6dtYkambLN2U-OMihzF0NFE/edit)
1. Gabby - Assign Salina to the Campaign Code column
1. Salina - Create the SFDC campaign and add Campaign Name and Campaign Code to the [Smartsheet](https://app.smartsheet.com/sheets/Jrr5PhjRjRfH965FqrvCq7GC9p56whHXp22C98m1). This will allow the Campaign Name to be displayed on the Distributor Marketing Campaign.
1. Salina - Add SFDC Campaign ID, SFDC Campaign Link and confirm the campaign name has been added to the Smartsheet under the `Added to smartsheet` column.-->

## List Import for Partner Leads

1. Create a list import issue using the issue template found in the Marketing Operations project titled [general-list-import-request](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/marketing-operations/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/general-list-import-request.md).
1. For the list import spreadsheet (found in the list import issue), be sure to follow the general [instructions](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/list-import/#import-methods-and-their-sla).
   1. For specific instructions related to Partner, here what you need to know:
        1. Ensure the `CRM Partner ID` column is populated with the Account 18 (ID)
        1. Lead should not be marked as `Opt-In`, unless they specifically opted in to **GitLab** emails.
        1. Phone number is mandatory for Impartner sync, make sure that field is populated.
1. Once spreadsheet is completed, proceed with [self service list import](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/automated-list-import/) instructions.
1. (no setup needed) Marketo will process.
    1. If there is a `CRM Partner ID` that equals to a Channel Partner Account ID (18),
        1. Set `Impartner Partner Account` - if CRM Partner ID is associated to a Channel Partner.
        1. Set `Partner Consent` = `True`
    1. If `CRM Partner ID` equals to a Alliance Partner Account ID (18),
        1. Do nothing.
1. (no setup needed) Interesting moments will dynamically change if there is a partner involved to reflect that.

## UTM Parameter URL

The UTM parameter URL plays a huge part on partner lead routing and reporting. We utilize `utm_partnerid` in the UTM parameter URL to capture the Account ID (18) of the Partner Account, which populates into the `CRM Partner ID`. This process is embedded as a hidden field in all our partner-related Marketo forms. Each page must have the `utm_partnerid` in the URL, otherwise we cannot pass to the partner.

You can use the [Partner UTM Builder](/handbook/marketing/utm-strategy/#how-to-create-utms) to create your URLs.

- utm_medium = `partner` (never changes)
- utm_soure = `partner` (never changes)
- GTM = `x` (never changes)
- Partner Name - utm_partnerid is a dropdown show all Channel Partners, and two Alliance Partners (AWS, and GCP). Select the partner you are working with.
- Fill out the rest of the UTM parameters

### Alliance Record

This field shows when a record belongs to an Alliance Partner meaning they are an employee of said Alliance Partner. When this field is checked = `true`, the record will be suppressed from general marketing communications.

### Channel Record

This field shows when a record belongs to a Channel Partner meaning they are an employee of said Channel Partner. When this field is checked = `true`, the record will be suppressed from general marketing communications.

### CRM Partner ID

This field is populated with the Salesforce `Account ID (18)` of Partner Account used for both Channel and Alliance.

For a running list of Channel Partners and their CRM IDs, which is critical to the channel partner lead flow, click [here](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/00O4M000004aSq6), while the `CRM Partner ID` for Alliance Partners can be found [here](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/00O8X000008mxIb).

### CRM Partner ID (Look up)

The lookup field retrieves the name of the partner account associated with the `Account ID (18)` used for both Channel and Alliance.

### Lead Acquisition Source

This field records the source type of the partner lead. The biggest driver for this field is to isolate the source type that applies to the recall process including `Owned Event`, `Service Management`.

The reason why [`Initial Source`](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/#initial-source) isn't used for this use case is because the field value must equal to `Partner Qualified Lead` to be attributed to and sourced by Partner.

### Partner Consent

This field indicates when a lead has granted consent to allow their information to be shared with a Partner. This only applies to Channel Partners because Alliance Partners are not enrolled in the lead-sharing module.

### Partner Type

This field specifies when a partner lead is associated with a Channel or Alliance Partner account.

### Partner Manager

This field reflects the `Account Owner`, Channel Account Manager or Partner Account Manager associated to the partner account.

### Subscribe - Partner

This field records when a lead has opted-in to Partner communications. Subscribe - Partner resides only in Marketo.

## About Strategy Programs

The Strategy Programs team designs, builds, manages and optimises programs that empower people to learn, use, contribute, and advocate for GitLab and its ecosystem. We provide structure and support to ensure that Developer Relations programs are consistent, measurable, scalable, and aligned with organisational goals.

Our programs are the tactical execution of the Developer Relations strategic vision, driving its [OKRs](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gitlab-OKRs/-/issues/?sort=updated_desc&state=opened&label_name%5B%5D=Division%3A%3AMarketing&label_name%5B%5D=Department%3A%3ADevRel%20%26%20Strategy&first_page_size=20) and contributing to its [KPIs](/handbook/marketing/developer-relations/performance-indicators/).

We work in collaboration with:

* Product and Engineering teams to ensure users' needs are represented on the GitLab roadmap.
* Marketing to showcase our members' success through featured content and events.
* Sales to provide smooth pathways for adoption that support revenue growth.

Our main responsibilities are:

* Defining our portfolio of programs
* Define and curate programs, including scope, objectives, metrics, and requirements
* Act as the DRI of our programs, identifying, prioritizing and driving the specific activities that contribute to its success
* Oversee the GitLab Ultimate license entitlement process for the GitLab for Education|Open Source programs
* Provide program support to the members of a program through Service Desk

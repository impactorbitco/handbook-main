## Overview

This page explains how we measure success in the Co-Create Program, how they're calculated, and why they matter.

## Current OKR (FY26 Q3 Example)

**Co-create with x large enterprise customers (enterprise tier) with > xxx amount influenced nARR**

### Components Explained

#### Contributing Customers (x large enterprise customers)

**What it measures:** The number of unique enterprise customer organizations (enterprise tier) that successfully contribute at least one merge request (MR) to GitLab within the quarter

**Why it matters:**

1. **Impact over activity:** Measures actual contributions, not workshops delivered or meetings held
1. Demonstrates customers are successfully enabled as contributors
1. Shows customers overcame all barriers (legal, technical, cultural) to contribute
1. Each contributing customer represents a deepened strategic relationship
1. Aligns with our goal of creating long-term contributors

**How we count it:**

1. A customer counts when they have at least one MR submitted to GitLab codebase during the quarter
1. Customer must be enterprise tier - this is a qualifier, not measured separately
1. One customer counts once per quarter, regardless of number of MRs, contributors, or MR state
1. MR must come from a company-sponsored contributor (using company email, company paying for their time)
1. **MR state does not matter** - open, merged, or closed MRs all count

#### Influenced Net ARR (> xxx amount)

**What it measures:** The sum of current total ARR from all contributing customers in the quarter

**Why it matters:**

1. Shows the total revenue value of customers engaged through the program
1. Demonstrates we're working with significant revenue accounts
1. Helps justify program resources

**How we calculate it:**

1. Identify all customers who contributed (submitted at least 1 MR) in the quarter
2. For each contributing customer, get their current total ARR from Salesforce
3. Sum the ARR across all contributing customers

## Playbook

### For Program Manager

#### Project Management & Tracking

All Co-Create customers are managed through our [Co-Create GitLab project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/developer-relations/strategy-programs/contributor/co-create-program).

##### Project Structure

1. **Epics**: One epic per customer to group all related work
1. **Issues**: Individual issues track each phase of the Co-Create journey:
   - Qualification & Planning
   - Technical Enablement

#### OKR Update Process

The Co-Create program tracks quarterly OKRs that require regular updates. This process allows any PM to generate reports without deep program familiarity.

##### Data Location

OKR data is maintained in the [Co-Create Metrics Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JqhcR2PSpKG3lQRU3Y8llo0K71aWWTrJNFjsjzGQiM4/edit?gid=1447987221#gid=1447987221). This data is updated via an automated pipeline.

##### Running the Update Pipeline

1. Navigate to [Contributor Success Toolbox Pipelines](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/developer-relations/contributor-success/toolbox/-/pipelines/new)
1. Click "Run pipeline"
1. Add the following variables:
   - `CO_CREATE_TRACKER = 1`
   - `PERIOD_START_DATE = YYYY-MM-DD` (start of the quarter)
   - `PERIOD_END_DATE = YYYY-MM-DD` (end of the current week or end of quarter)
   - `DRY_RUN = 0`
   - `CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE = schedule`
   - `CO_CREATE_REPORT_SHEET_ID = 1JqhcR2PSpKG3lQRU3Y8llo0K71aWWTrJNFjsjzGQiM4`
1. Click "Run pipeline" and wait for completion (typically a few minutes)
1. Monitor status until it shows "job succeeded" or "job failed"

##### Troubleshooting Pipeline Failures

1. Access the "Jobs" tab of the pipeline
1. Open the failed job to review error details
1. Address issues and re-run pipeline

##### Using the Results

1. Open or refresh the [Co-Create results file](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JqhcR2PSpKG3lQRU3Y8llo0K71aWWTrJNFjsjzGQiM4)
1. Navigate to the "Calculator" tab
1. Update the Source sheet field with the dates used in your pipeline (corresponds to sheet name)
1. Use the calculated results to update:
   - Quarterly OKR progress
   - End of Week reports

##### Update Frequency

Run this pipeline weekly during the quarter or as needed for reporting. Note: Automatic scheduling is pending implementation; currently requires manual execution.

## FAQ

### For Account Teams

**Q: Which customers are eligible?**

A: Premium or Ultimate tier customers with CSM support. Ideal candidates have engineering capacity, technical curiosity, and interest in platform enhancements. Prior open source experience is beneficial but not required.

**Q: What if my customer wants to contribute but isn't Premium/Ultimate?**

A: They can still contribute through our standard community contribution path. The Co-Create Program's white-glove service (on-site engineer, dedicated workshops) is reserved for Premium/Ultimate customers.

**Q: How do I convince my customer this is worth their time?**

A: Share these points:

1. Research shows contributing firms achieve up to 2x productivity gains
1. GitLab maintains their contributions forever—zero ongoing maintenance burden
1. Faster than traditional feature request process
1. Builds deep platform expertise that improves their internal GitLab usage

**Q: What's the time commitment for my customer?**

A: Typically 1-3 engineers for 1 week on-site, plus 2-3 hours for GDK setup workshop beforehand. Post-engagement time varies based on merge request feedback cycles.

**Q: Can customers work on any issue they want?**

A: Contributions must align with GitLab's product direction. We maintain a [curated list](https://cocreate.gitlab.com/?label=co-create) of pre-approved issues. Custom issues require Product Manager approval.

**Q: What if legal is concerned about contributions?**

A: We have a [Compatibility Guide for Corporate Contributors](/handbook/marketing/developer-relations/strategy-programs/cocreate/license-compatibility-guide) and can arrange consultation with our legal experts. The Corporate Contributor Agreement is standard across tech companies with open source contributions.

**Q: How is this different from a feature request?**

A: Feature requests enter product prioritization process with uncertain timelines. Co-Create allows customers to develop what they need immediately, with GitLab maintaining it long-term.

### For Customers

**Q: Do we need Ruby or Go experience?**

A: Not required. GitLab engineers provide pair programming support and teach as you code. Prior experience with any programming language is sufficient.

**Q: Who owns the code we contribute?**

A: Please refer to https://about.gitlab.com/community/contribute/dco-cla/#do-i-retain-rights-in-my-contributions

**Q: What happens if our contribution isn't accepted?**

A: Product Manager approval occurs before the on-site week to ensure alignment. During development, GitLab engineers guide you to meet quality standards. Rejection is extremely rare with this level of support.

**Q: Can we contribute to multiple areas?**

A: Yes! Returning customers often expand their contributions. Initial engagements typically focus on one area to build confidence and establish processes.

**Q: What if we need specific network configurations or can't run GDK locally?**

A: We work with you to find solutions. GitLab Workspaces can help overcome network restrictions. The enablement workshop addresses environment challenges before the on-site week.

**Q: How quickly will our contribution be in a GitLab release?**

A: Timeline varies by contribution complexity and review cycles. Contributions always ship in the next release following merge request approval.

**Q: Can we publicize our participation?**

A: Yes! We encourage it. We can support joint announcements, blog posts, and conference presentations. Many customers use Co-Create as part of their open source programs office initiatives.

### For GitLab Team Members

**Q: How are on-site engineers selected?**

A: Engineering leadership identifies engineers with expertise in relevant codebase areas, availability, and interest in mentorship. Engineers typically volunteer for these engagements.

**Q: What if a contribution requires significant architectural changes?**

A: These should be identified during the qualification phase. Product Managers assess scope and may recommend breaking large contributions into smaller iterations or starting with a simpler related issue.

**Q: How do we handle contributions that conflict with planned work?**

A: Product Manager alignment happens before commitment. If conflicts arise, we work with the customer to find alternative contribution opportunities that don't create conflicts.

**Q: What if the customer wants to continue contributing after the on-site week?**

A: Excellent! Connect them with Contributor Success team for ongoing mentorship. Many customers become long-term contributors.

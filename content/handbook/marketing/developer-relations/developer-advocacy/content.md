### Product tours

Product tours are a self-guided journey emphasizing the 'What' of a feature, skipping the 'How-to' steps to directly showcase the value aspects.

#### Centralized demo hub

We've created a centralized demo hub that brings together all our product tours in one location. Access demos organized across three key areas: **Duo Agent Platform**, **Security**, and **DevSecOps Platform**.

**[Explore the Demo Zone →](https://dap-demo-hub-dac14a.gitlab.io/)**

#### Short product tours

This section lists shorter versions of product tours with fewer steps (typically under 15 steps), useful for demo booths at events and when you need to show a quick demonstration.

| Title | Area | Last updated | DRI | # of Steps |
|-------|------|--------------|-----|------------|

#### Internal Product tours

While the [product tours](#product-tours) provide guided walkthroughs with navigation dialogs and explanations at each step and can serve as self-guided tours for customers, the internal product tours are designed to help GitLab team members demo features to customers and prospects. These tours omit the explanation dialogs, creating a seamless live demo experience. Refer to the navigation guides to learn how to navigate through the flows.

### Workshops

The Developer Advocacy team maintains workshops in different product and focus areas. A workshop can be of different types: Hands-on with audience participating live in the exercises (training course), or showcase live demo/programming sessions where the audience engages with questions. Workshops should be created in collaboration with the [Solution Architect](/handbook/solutions-architects/) and  [Customer Success](/handbook/customer-success/) teams, and aligned with business goals.

> Note: Specific customer focussed workshops can be requested following the [customer consultancy handbook](/handbook/marketing/developer-relations/developer-advocacy/consultancy/).

### Click-through Demos

Click-through demos are product simulation demonstrations that can be used for self-guided training. They are invaluable for delivering demos to customers in areas with limited internet connectivity or complex environments, where preparation is necessary to showcase the flow. Toggle off the click boxes and speaker notes using fn+F2 to experience the real look and feel of the product.

### Projects

Source code, demo projects, workshops, tutorials, research, etc. are documented in the [Projects handbook](/handbook/marketing/developer-relations/developer-advocacy/projects/). This includes use cases for GitLab Duo (AI), CI/CD components, DevSecOps and Security, Workspaces, GitLab API, etc.

## Content Creation

### Video Guidelines

For your screen recording:

1. Tools: We recommend Quicktime, [OBS](#recording-with-obs) or [Screen Studio](#recording-with-screen-studio).
   - Post-editing: Adobe Premiere Pro (video cuts, audio gain boost, etc)
   - Ask @johncoghlan for tool access and create [Access Requests](/handbook/security/corporate/end-user-services/access-requests/).
1. Video settings to follow:
   - Aspect Ratio / Resolution: Set window size to an aspect ratio of 16x9.
       - Common resolution is 1920×1080 (16:9 aspect ratio) or 2880×1750 for screen recordings.
       - If recording for social, consider square (1:1) for multi-platform compatibility or vertical (9:16).
       - If you're connected to a 4K monitor, it may be easier to capture from your laptop.
   - If using Screen Studio for videos that will be used in videos edited by the Brand team, please follow this guidance:
       - Remove all Zooms in Screen Studio, the brand team will add Zooms as needed.
       - Set rounded corners and padding to 0% to maximize screen size.
       - Turn on `Always use pointer cursor`.
       - Set cursor size to 1.2x, use the left-most `Cursor style` option.
       - Export as follows: Format - MP4, Resolution - 1080p, and Compression - Web.

Demo environments setup:

1. User accounts
   - Prefer the [demo-tanuki account](https://gitlab.com/demo-tanuki) for brand demos. (login is in 1Password, Marketing vault)
   - Use your own accounts (or GDK admin) for all other demos.
1. GitLab UI in Chrome browser
   - Zoom: 125% (or 110% as alternative)
   - Minimized bookmarks bar (`cmd shift b`)
   - Theme: White
   - GitLab layout width: Fluid ([`Profile > Settings > Layout width`](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/profile/preferences/#change-the-layout-width-on-the-ui))
1. IDEs in [Dev Environments](/handbook/marketing/developer-relations/developer-advocacy/dev-environments/)
   - Be overly generous with zoom in your IDE so that our viewers can clearly see what is happening on screen.
   - VS Code: Zoom (`cmd` + `+`) once or twice more than you think you need to.
   - JetBrains: `Settings > Appearance & Behavior > Appearance > Accessibility > Zoom`. `125%` worked best in tests by @dnsmichi
   - Simplify your IDE by closing unnecessary tabs and toolbar items.
   - [Disable all AI integrations from IDE vendors](https://internal.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/developer-relations/developer-advocacy/dev-environments).
   - You can simplify view by hiding unnecessary icons that are nested in top and bottom bars or using Zen mode, `cmd`+`k`+`z`

Additional guidance can be found in the internal handbook: [dev environments](https://internal.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/developer-relations/developer-advocacy/dev-environments)

1. Where is the video artifact being used (YouTube, blog embed, social).

#### Recording with Screen Studio

Screen Studio offers to capture screen areas, windows and combine it with the webcam view. It comes with a simple intuitive recording and editing UI, and uses intelligent automated ["zooming into scenes"](https://screen.studio/guide/adding-editing-zooms) with a timeline to edit.

Screen Studio provides a minimal overlay UI to [start a recording](https://screen.studio/guide/new-recording).

![Screen Studio overlay menu](/images/handbook/marketing/developer-relations/developer-advocacy/content/screenstudio-overlay-menu.png)

1. Select Display, Window or Area
   - Screen Studio can record any resolution but it is recommended to use 16:9 or 4:3 depending on [specification](#screen-studio-recording-specifications).
   - Area: Select the AR and drag through the recording region.

   ![Screen Studio area selection](/images/handbook/marketing/developer-relations/developer-advocacy/content/screenstudio-recording-area-selector.png)

1. Click record to start recording.

After finishing the recording, choose to [save the project first](https://screen.studio/guide/saving-your-project), and then open the editor.

![Screen Studio editor](/images/handbook/marketing/developer-relations/developer-advocacy/content/screenstudio-editor.png)

1. In the editor, you can review all settings, video alignments, Zoom timeline, etc. before saving the final video.
1. There you can set:
    - Padding (left and right)
    - Constant cursor size
    - Zoom timeline with multiple automated, AI-based zooms
1. After making these adjustments, save the project.
1. Then `export` and `Export to file`.
1. In the [export dialog](https://screen.studio/guide/exporting-the-video), choose `mp4` under `.mp4` dropdown

Screen Studio saves projects on disk in the `~/Screen Studio Projects` folder. Project files follow the name and `.screenstudio` extension, which are containers with raw video files and settings.

!![Screen Studio projects on disk](/images/handbook/marketing/developer-relations/developer-advocacy/content/screenstudio-projects-on-disk.png)

You can inspect them on the terminal with `ls` and re-open them in the `Screen Studio` project list.

![Screen Studio - Open previous projects](/images/handbook/marketing/developer-relations/developer-advocacy/content/screenstudio-open-previous-projects.png)

After finishing the content delivery, it is recommended to upload all video files (exported artifacts and Screen Studio Projects) to the team GDrive to save local storage.

##### Screen Studio Recording specifications

Recordings delivered to product marketing/brand video team need to follow these specs:

1. Resolution: 1920x1080 (16:9 aspect ratio).
   - Screen Studio can record any resolution that follows the 16:9 aspect ratio requirements, and then export 1920x1080 resolutions (e.g. a 4K monitor, or portion of a 49" monitor)
1. [Exported recording artifact](https://screen.studio/guide/exporting-the-video): `mp4`
1. Settings:
    - No padding
    - Always show Cursor
    - Cursor size: 1.2x
    - No additional Zooms/Edits
1. No webcam / user view.

Other demo recordings

1. Follow the same settings as for brand video, but experiment with the best layout for the audience.
   - Add [automated zooms](https://screen.studio/guide/auto-zoom) and review them before export.
   - Social media: Square video or export as GIF.
   - YouTube: 16:9, 1920x1080, more padding.
1. Always add your webcam video to tutorials, walkthroughs and deep-dives to provide a human personal touch.

#### Recording with OBS

In many cases, OBS will allow greater control and flexibility for screen recordings.

Here are some tips to keep in mind:

1. Scene - a scene is a collection of sources that you will record simultaneously.
1. Sources - sources can be audio, screen recordings, webcams, etc.
   - To add a source, click the `+` icon. These are the three most common sources you will use:
      - macOS Screen Capture: screen recordings
      - Audio Input Capture: optional, when direct voice recording is needed
      - Video Capture Input: optional with speaker/webcam in the recording
   - To record your Macbook screen, use `macOS Screen Capture`, give the source a name, and right-click to edit the Source properties.
   - Properties - these are elements of the Source you can modify. You can choose between different screens (laptop vs monitor) as well as whether to capture the whole screen, a window, or a specific application.
1. Preferences - preferences control how your Scene gets recorded. We recommend the following preferences:
   - OBS > Preferences > Video
      - Base (Canvas) Resolution 1920x1080, Aspect ratio 16:9
      - Output (Scaled) Resolution 1920x1080, Aspect ratio 16:9
   - OBS > Preferences > Output > Dropdown: Advanced.
      - OBS > Preferences > Advanced: Enable "Recording > Automatically remux to mp4" (this is important for Adobe Premiere Pro which cannot import mkv containers)

#### Post-editing with Adobe Premiere Pro

Access: Requires an [Access Request](/handbook/security/corporate/end-user-services/access-requests/), [example](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/team-member-epics/access-requests/-/issues/30951).

Review the [Developer Advocacy showcase notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1co-DKoR4xn4JNIcynWPjoJsWo3vYzwj8WDFzX3uKrH0/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.yrmatlea9dpq) (internal) and [recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNH8NDShGJA) (public).

#### Audio gain boost with professional broadcaster microphones

If you are using a professional broadcaster microphone (e.g. Shure SM7B), and the audio gain is too low, there are different options:

1. The hardware solution (audio interface + Cloudlifter) will greatly improve initial results, as the SM7B microphone really needs that extra gain before it reaches your computer.
1. OBS Recording
   - Increase the audio gain in OBS during recordings.
   - Locate `Source > Audio Capture Device`
   - Right-click and select `Filters`
   - Set Gain to +10 or +20dB.
   - Noise Suppression: RNNoise or Speex
   - Compressor: Ratio 3:1, Threshold -18dB, Attack 6ms, Release 60ms
   - Limiter: Threshold -6dB, Release 60ms
   - Tip: Ask [Claude](/handbook/tools-and-tips/ai/claude/) for best practice settings (prompt: `How to boost audio in OBS for a SureSM7B microphone as input?`).
1. Post-edit for Screen Studio
   - Edit the Screen Studio exported recording in Adobe Premiere Pro, and adjust the audio.
   - Create a new project and add the video source in the media browser.
   - Drag and drop the video into the right editor scope.
   - Right-click on the audio track, and select `Audio Gain`.
   - Choose `Set Gain to:` and enter `25 dB`.

### Product Tours guidelines

#### Guideline and tips for creating GitLab tours with Navattic

1. **Keep it concise** – Product tours should ideally have **5 to 12 steps**, each focused on delivering clear value. Unlike tutorials, which tend to be instructional, product tours should be quick and engaging.
2. **Provide context** – Add links to blog posts and documentation in pop-up dialogs to provide additional resources without cluttering the main content.
3. **Apply GitLab branding** – In the theme settings, select **"GitLab Branding [Navattic Team]"** to ensure a consistent design.
4. **Use the appropriate capture type** – Navattic supports two types of screen captures:
   - **Web captures** (preferred) create an in-product experience.
   - **Screenshots** should be used for non-web-based applications (e.g., IDEs).
5. **Set the correct resolution** – When capturing in Chrome, set your browser to **1680x1050 (Full HD)**. You can use [Window Resizer](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/window-resizer/kkelicaakdanhinjdeammmilcgefonfh) to adjust the resolution.
6. **Include a call to action** – The final step should feature a **CTA**, typically a **Free Trial** link.
7. **Use Beacons to highlight elements** – Apply the **Highlight** appearance setting to emphasize key elements.
8. **Enable keyboard navigation** – This features in the tour settings allows users to navigate the tour using arrow keys for a smoother experience.
9. **Use Presenter Mode** – This feature hides pop-ups when necessary, ensuring a cleaner visual presentation.
10. **Set pop-ups appropriately**:
    - Use **Modals** with a **heavy backdrop** for the first and last steps.
    - Use **Tooltips** for intermediate steps, enabling the **Backdrop setting** when appropriate.
11. In the Dialogs, please try using action-specific labels like "Commit," "Install," or "Submit" instead of "Next" to make users feel like they are actively engaging with the product.
12. **Refer to available examples** – Review [existing product tours](#product-tours) to understand the preferred format.
13. Before releasing any public facing product tour, request a review from the Developer Advocacy team.

#### Requesting Access to Navattic

If your team has special requirements for tours and you want to develop tours with Navattic yourself, we can help.

- We can offer a **3-month trial license** to team members who request access and provide a **valid business justification** for using Navattic.
- If a user actively utilizes the tool, we may **extend their access** or consider purchase additional licenses as needed.
- If a user is not actively using the tool, their license may be **reassigned** to another team member.
- To request access, open an [issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/developer-relations/developer-advocacy/developer-advocacy-meta/-/issues/new?issuable_template=other-activities)

For questions or assistance, reach out to us in our team channel: [#dev-advocacy-team](https://app.slack.com/client/T02592416/CMELFQS4B).

#### Publishing Product Tours

Product tours are published in the following locations:

- [Developer Advocacy content library](#product-tours)
- [Highspot](#highspot)
- [GitLab documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/) (follow the GitLab documentation style guide for demo [links](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/styleguide/#link-to-click-through-demos))

Additionally, select tours may be featured on the website.

#### Contribute to product tours

The Developer Advocacy team creates product tours to showcase key workflows and highlight new features, such as **Advanced SAST**, **GitLab Duo**, **GitLab Duo with Amazon Q**, [and more](#product-tours). The team is committed to building, reviewing, and publishing product tours to ensure a consistent and high-quality experience for our users and potential customers. You can also contribute by proposing additional tours and provide the content, script, and environment. Here is how you can collaborate with the Developer Advocacy team to create new product tours:

1. Use the [product tour submission template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/developer-relations/developer-advocacy/developer-advocacy-meta/-/issues/new?issuable_template=product-tour-submission-template) to propose your idea.
1. Answer all the questions in the template. This ensures the Developer Advocacy team can evaluate your idea effectively.
1. The Developer Advocacy team will review the pitch and either a) greenlight the tour and suggest timeline for creation based on other priorities the team has, b) offer suggestions for improvements, or c) explain why the idea might not be a fit for the tour and offer other ideas for getting the message out.
1. Once a tour is approved, the author will use the **product tour template** (google doc) to draft the script. Link to the template exists in the [product tour submission template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/developer-relations/developer-advocacy/developer-advocacy-meta/-/issues/new?issuable_template=product-tour-submission-template).
1. Add a link to the template in a comment in the submisson template issue.
1. The Developer Advocacy team will collaborate with the author on the script, use Navattic to create the tour, and publish it in the official targets when applicable (for example, website, docs, HighSpot, Developer Advocacy handbook).

## Content Distribution

### UTMs for URL tagging and tracking

The Developer Advocacy team works with the Developer Relations Team [UTM Strategy](/handbook/marketing/developer-relations/utm-strategy/), which is based on the larger [Marketing UTM strategy](/handbook/marketing/utm-strategy/). The `utm_content` prefix for the Developer Evangelism team is `de_`, this allows for easily filtering of the team's data in Sisense.

You can use the [UTM Generator](/handbook/marketing/developer-relations/utm-strategy/#utm-generator) on the Community UTM Page to easily generate UTM Codes for your campaigns.

We use the following campaigns:

1. [Blog posts (general)](https://campaign-manager.gitlab.com/campaigns/view/17) - All GitLab blog where we are not authors. Content tracking for social media.
1. [Blog posts (authors)](https://campaign-manager.gitlab.com/campaigns/view/18) - GitLab blog posts where we are authors. Content tracking for social media.
1. [Talk resources (general)](https://campaign-manager.gitlab.com/campaigns/view/13) - QR codes and short URLs for talk slides.
1. [Community newsletter](https://campaign-manager.gitlab.com/campaigns/view/27) - community newsletter short URLs.
1. [Demos (TMM, DE)](https://campaign-manager.gitlab.com/campaigns/view/50) - technical demos with standalone URLs.
1. [Release Evangelism](https://campaign-manager.gitlab.com/campaigns/view/3) - [Release evangelism activities](/handbook/marketing/developer-relations/developer-advocacy/social-media/#release-evangelism).
1. [Podcast resources](https://campaign-manager.gitlab.com/campaigns/view/38) - URLs shared with podcast hosts.
1. [Contributed articles](https://campaign-manager.gitlab.com/campaigns/view/47) - external articles shared on social media.

Event and content specific tracking examples are [KubeCon EU 2023](https://campaign-manager.gitlab.com/campaigns/view/36).

### Content Distribution Workflow

After content has been crafted and published, the next step is distribution. Here are some steps to assist in the process:

1. Use the [UTM Generator](/handbook/marketing/developer-relations/utm-strategy/#utm-generator) to create UTM codes and short URLs for your content. Further insights about this can be found in the Developer Advocacy [UTM Strategy](/handbook/marketing/developer-relations/utm-strategy/).

For documentation and community:

1. Tutorial blog posts, demos, etc. that are helpful to everyone should be added to the [GitLab documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/). Follow the contribution docs and create [related topics](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/topic_types/#related-topics) headings if not existing. Raise an MR, use content short URLs, and ask the [assigned technical writer](/handbook/product/ux/technical-writing/#assignments) to review. Example MR: [Add tutorial blog posts to workspaces docs](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/127500)
1. Consider sharing your content on one of our community platforms like the [GitLab Forum](https://forum.gitlab.com/) or the [r/gitlab](https://www.reddit.com/r/gitlab) subreddit. If you're covering a topic that's broader than GitLab, you can also consider other subreddits or cross-posting your content on blogging sites like dev.to.

For social media:

1. Draft some copy for sharing your content on social media. See [Content Sharing](/handbook/marketing/developer-relations/developer-advocacy/social-media/#content) for tips and an overview of different platforms. Review the [message tips](/handbook/marketing/developer-relations/developer-advocacy/social-media/#message-tips) for additional engagement ideas, e.g. emojis.
1. Suggest your content as a story on EveryoneSocial so other GitLab team members can also share it. [Details on how to suggest content on EveryoneSocial](/handbook/marketing/integrated-marketing/digital-strategy/social-marketing/team-member-social-advocacy/#suggesting-content-for-team-members-to-share-on-everyonesocial).
1. After posting your content on social media, share a link in the [`#social-media-action`](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C01AZ9C8Z4G) Slack channel to request promotion from the social media team.

For GitLab teams:

1. Content that can be useful to our Field Teams, should also be posted in [Highspot](https://gitlab.highspot.com/).
1. Share an update in the [#dev-advocacy-team](https://app.slack.com/client/T02592416/CMELFQS4B) Slack channel using the following message template:

```text
:results-tanuki: <Content type> published: <title>

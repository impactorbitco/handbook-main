## Lifecycle Marketing

## Overview
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

Lifecycle Marketing is responsible for strategizing, executing, and optimizing a data-driven user lifecycle communications strategy and overall email marketing plan, including ongoing nurture email campaigns.

This role works closely across Marketing for all things email, and directly with the Product Growth, Data, and Self-service Teams to collaborate, plan, and prioritize communication to better engage GitLab users and progress them through the buyer and customer lifecycle. Our goal is to showcase GitLab’s value, empower effective product use, and drive meaningful connections through touchpoints like sales meetings, events, and webinars.

For more information on email marketing at GitLab, please visit the following pages:

### Issue Templates

We ask that teams request work using the following issue templates in the campaigns project. These templates more clearly indicate what information and details are required in order for the request to be triaged.

Note on timelines: The campaigns team is focused on campaign strategy, execution, and optimization. Team member milestones focus on work to drive MQLs and SAOs, and requests will be committed to as bandwidth permits at discretion of Lifecycle Team Manager.

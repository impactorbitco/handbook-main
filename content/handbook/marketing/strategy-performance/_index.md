### Who to Assign Issues To

Assign issues based on the "Team Members & Stakeholder Alignment" table. Unassigned issues trigger weekly alerts via our custom triage bot.

## Our Work

We publish self-service dashboards to help teams understand key marketing KPIs. Our [dashboard page](/handbook/marketing/strategy-performance/dashboards/) lists our supported dashboards and the framework for publishing a new one.

Our Dashboards are based on the metrics defined in our [Marketing Metrics](/handbook/marketing/strategy-performance/marketing-metrics/) page.

### What We Support

We build dashboards and reporting using GitLab's [Enterprise Data Warehouse](/handbook/enterprise-data/platform/) (EDW), including:

- Source of Truth (SoT) Tableau dashboards
- Ad-hoc reports in Snowflake and Tableau
- Ad-hoc investigations in Google Sheets

We don't support SoT or campaigns based Dashboards in Salesforce.

## How We Work

We plan quarterly to align projects with company objectives, which receive priority in our workflow. We organize work in monthly milestones and 2-week iterations. Unplanned ad-hoc issues are triaged based on urgency and alignment with company objectives.

### Issue Board

Each MA team member has an issue board at the Marketing project level (search for `Marketing Analytics`). Boards track task progression through the following status columns:

- **New:** Issues awaiting triage
- **Start:** Triaged and ready for next iteration
- **In Dev:** Active work in current iteration
- **In Review:** Awaiting stakeholder feedback or QA review
- **Blocked:** Blocked by another task
- **Complete:** Done

### Issue Weights

Marketing Analytics uses the Fibonacci sequence when creating [issue weights](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issues/issue_weight.html). We start with a weight of 2, smaller is too simple for an issue. Similarly, we break any issue larger than 13 into an epic.

### Epics

In order to categorize various related issues, we make use of epics to help each team member organize their work, especially when it crosses multiple milestones. If it is a Marketing Analytics epic, we will add the In Epic label to it, so that we can easily see that it is part of an epic on our kanban board.

### Milestones

The Marketing Analytics team works in one month milestones at the /gitlab-dot-com/ level. Each individual contributor (IC) is responsible for adding issues to the milestone that will be completed in the two week time frame. If needed, the IC will separate the main issue into smaller pieces that are *workable* segments of the larger request.

## Operational Timeline of Changes

Periodically Marketing Analytics becomes aware of significant changes that affect overall data and reporting. To capture these, we have a shared [Operational timeline of events](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1vhGvEszndMJ4B9EshGFSdTTABwUzBzDObz93vkMSFGA) with the MktgOps team. They primarily add any process changes to this document as they occur. It has been a great communication tool, especially as we look back at metrics in the past and can track the changes that were made.

## Blog (about.gitlab.com/blog/)

### Where can I find blog posts?

Blog posts can be found in two different locations:

1. [Yaml files in the about.gitlab.com Repository](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/digital-experience/about-gitlab-com/-/tree/main/content?ref_type=heads)
2. [Decap CMS](https://about.gitlab.com/admin/blog/)

### Creating a blog post in the about.gitlab.com repository

Creating a blog post from scratch is as easy as filling out the [blog post template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/digital-experience/about-gitlab-com/-/blob/main/.gitlab/merge_request_templates/blog-post.md?ref_type=heads). This can be done using the WebIDE, or by setting up the project locally.

1. Copy the example yaml document, and place it under the `/blog/` folder within the appropriate locale. For example, English blog posts would be under `/content/en-us/blog/`
2. Add an author (first name, last name). If the author does not already exist in this [list of authors](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/digital-experience/about-gitlab-com/-/tree/main/content/en-us/blog/authors?ref_type=heads), you can create a new one by copying and pasting the format of an existing author.
3. Fill in the remaining sections of the yaml file, using markdown for the body of the blog post, and assign your merge request to `@Sgittlen` for review.

### Creating a blog post using Decap CMS

```

1. Log into Decap by visiting https://about.gitlab.com/admin/ and entering your GitLab credentials.
1. Navigate to the Blog Dashboard via right navigation panel OR by going to https://about.gitlab.com/admin/blog/
1. Using the language of your choice, select a `Blog - Post` Collection.
1. Fill in the fields under `Content`. Most fields are required unless otherwise noted. (You may also fill out the `SEO` fields - if you leave them blank, they will populate automatically with the Title and Description from the `Content` section.The last section, `Config`, can optionally be used to change the slug, and set the blog post to be Featured on the blog landing page.)
1. Click `Save` in the upper right corner.
1. Check the latest [Merge Requests](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/digital-experience/about-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests) in the about.gitlab.com repository. A new merge request titled "Create Blog - Post {title}" will have automatically been created.
1. Within that MR, you will be able to view the review app of your blog post, and tag `@Sgittlen` for approval and merge.
1. Deleting a non-published post in Decap will end up **closing the MR**. If you are looking for that content, it will remain in the GitLab UI.

Video Tutorials can be found at the following [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91Ul69LrSb4&list=PL05JrBw4t0KoIEZXWugERwHAsR2cEalKl). For assistance, please reach out to `#digital-experience-team` or `#blog` in slack.

#### Additonal Notes

- Note that the swim lames/board in the Workflow tab correspond to labels applied to the various MRs.
- If you want to add an author, category, or tag, you will need to create those in Decap and merge the MRs in to the `main` branch first. Once that is complete the author, category, or tag will become available to be selected in Decap when creating or editing an existing article.

### Creating a blog post using the Web IDE

1. Visit the project repository at https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/digital-experience/about-gitlab-com
1. Click the `Edit` button dropdown, and select `Open with Web IDE`
1. Once open, navigate to the folder you'd like your blog post in
    - For most, this will be in `content -> en-us -> blog`
    - Localized blog posts can be found in the content/{{language-code}} folder, such as `content -> fr-fr -> blog`
1. Add a new file by clicking the `Add file` button at the top of the sidebar pane. Be sure to name your file whatever the url of the blog post will be
    - Alternatively, if you have an existing yaml file (i.e. from Argo), you can drag and drop the file directly into the folder of your choosing. Be sure to `right click -> rename` the file to match the English version
1. From here, you can copy and paste an existing blog post yaml file and fill in your new values, or use the [blog MR template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/digital-experience/about-gitlab-com/-/blob/main/.gitlab/merge_request_templates/blog-post.md?ref_type=heads) to start from scratch
    - Be sure to either upload your blog image inside [/public/images/blog/hero-images/](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/digital-experience/about-gitlab-com/-/tree/main/public/images/blog/hero-images?ref_type=heads), or copy a URL from Cloudinary
1. Once you're happy with your post, you can create a merge request through the Web IDE by selecting the `Source Control` icon on the left sidebar, then click the dropdown beside the `Commit and push to main` button -> `Create a new branch and commit` (you won't be able to commit and push to `main` directly)
    - Hit `Enter` to just use the default branch name
    - Click the `Create MR` button that appears in the bottom corner
1. Wait for the pipeline to run to view your review app

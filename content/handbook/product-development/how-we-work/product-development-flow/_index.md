title: Product Development Flow
description: Cross-functional product development workflow process and labeling.
---

## Overview & philosophy

GitLab's product mission is to consistently create products and experiences that users love and
value. To deliver on this mission, it's important to have a clearly defined and repeatable flow for
turning an idea into something that offers customer value. Note that it's also important to allow
open source contributions at any point in the process from the wider GitLab community - these won't
necessarily follow this process.

This page is an evolving description of how we expect our cross-functional development teams to work, and reflects the current workflow being leveraged. All required actions or outcomes in this page are denoted as follows:

> <i class="fab fa-gitlab fa-fw" style="color:rgb(252,109,38); font-size:1.25em" aria-hidden="true"></i> Denotes a required aspect of the product development flow.

Feature development is expected to pass through all phases to achieve specified outcomes, while the rest of the workflow should be considered as a set of best practices, tools, and recommendations. We realize there are unique cases in which certain product improvements may not need to flow through all the phases. We trust product managers to use their best judgement with alignment from their design and engineering team. The goal of this page is to support teams in their workflows by highlighting the necessary **outcomes** to target in each phase as well as sharing strategies/tactics, **activities**, teams can employ to achieve these  outcomes. Additionally, this page aims to clarify the *minimal* set of required actions, such as labels, needed across all phases to keep the product system efficient in terms of tracking, searching and cross-functional collaboration. To maintain clarity and avoid confusion, we do not list optional actions on this page but teams may choose to employ additional actions, such as labels for planning, even if they are not mentioned on this page.

As teams leverage the product development flow, they may find that certain strategies/tactics are serving their teams well toward success. Therefore, we welcome MRs to this page, so we can create a robust playbook of options to build valuable features for customers. All team members are encouraged to follow the [change process](#contributing-to-this-page) for this page to share their best practices.

## But Wait, Isn't This Waterfall?

No. Although the phases described on this page appear to be independent and linear, they are not. They're presented in this way for simplicity and ease of navigation. At GitLab, we do not promote working in a linear manner. Phases in the product development lifecycle may overlap or occur in parallel.

We aim to achieve key outcomes in each phase in order to de-risk subsequent phases. However, the product development flow doesn't dictate the order we go through the phases, or the time spent in each. When teams have a high confidence in their direction, they should feel empowered to skip or shorten phases that won't contribute to improved confidence.

Examples:

- An engineering team conducts a technical review while other team members are performing Validation Phase activities. The team can then move to the Build phase rapidly with high confidence that their improvement is good for customers and technically feasible.

- A bug is reported by a GitLab customer. The Product Manager tests the bug and confirms its existence (Problem Validation). The team is extremely confident in the solution, so Design and Solution Validation are not needed. The bug is moved immediately to Build.

## Workflow Summary

Through the page, whenever a [DRI](/handbook/people-group/directly-responsible-individuals/) is mentioned, the person referred to may be different depending on the phase, and there may be more than one.
For who the DRI is, refer to the [Product Development Roles and Responsibilities page](../roles-and-responsibilities/).

> <i class="fab fa-gitlab fa-fw" style="color:rgb(252,109,38); font-size:1.25em" aria-hidden="true"></i> We use workflow labels to efficiently communicate an issue's state. Using these labels enables collaboration across teams and communicates an issue's current state.

The workflow labels are prefixed with `workflow::`, such as `workflow::ready for development`. The following diagram shows how a new issue moves to each workflow label, though states can be skipped when appropriate. The rest of this document describes each workflow step in detail.

### Issue descriptions as the Single Source of Truth (SSOT)

> <i class="fab fa-gitlab fa-fw" style="color:rgb(252,109,38); font-size:1.25em" aria-hidden="true"></i> Issue descriptions shall always be maintained as the single source of truth.

It's not [efficient](/handbook/values/#efficiency) for contributors to need to read every comment in an issue to understand the current state.

- Issue description accuracy should be maintained by the DRIs throughout each phase. However all collaborators can and should contribute when they see discrepancies or needed updates.

### Prioritization

Guidance on what and how to prioritize is covered in:

1. [R&D Interlock](/handbook/product-development/how-we-work/r-and-d-interlock/)
1. [Cross-functional Prioritization](/handbook/product/product-processes/cross-functional-prioritization/)
1. [Customer Issues Prioritization](/handbook/product/product-processes/customer-issues-prioritization-framework/)

## Validation track

For situations [when the customer problem isn't well understood](/handbook/product/ux/ux-research/when-to-conduct-ux-research/#design-the-right-thingproblem-validation), Product Managers (PMs) and the User Experience Department (UXers) should work together to validate new opportunities before moving to the Build track. The **Validation** track is an independent track from the always moving **Build** track. PMs and UXers should work together to get at least two months ahead, so that the Build track always has well-validated product opportunities ready to start. Milestone work should be [prioritized](/handbook/product/product-processes/) with the understanding that some milestones may include more validation efforts than others. Validation cycles may not be necessary for things like bug fixes, well understood iterative improvements, minor design fixes, and technical debt.

### Validation Spectrum

The types of activities and depth of research required in the validation track will depend on how well we understand the customer problem and solution.

![Validation Spectrum](/images/product-development/product-development-flow/validation-spectrum.png "Validation Spectrum")

### Validation Goals & Outcomes

**When:** When our confidence about the proposed problem or solution isn't high. For example, if we aren't reasonably sure that the problem is important to a significant number of users, or that the solution is easy to understand and use.

**Who:** Product Manager, Product Designer, UX Researcher, Product Design Manager, Engineering Manager

**What:**

✅ **Understand** the user problem we are trying to solve.

✅ **Identify** business goals and key metrics to determine success.

✅ **Generate** hypotheses and research/experiment/user-test.

✅ **Define** MVC and potential future iterations.

✅ **Minimize** risks to value, usability, feasibility, and business viability with qualitative and quantitative analysis.

**Outcome:** We have confidence that a proposed solution will positively impact one or more [Product KPIs](/handbook/company/kpis/#product-kpis). There may be reason for exceptions, so the team would need to be clear in that case, and be able to justify that it's still important without mapping back to our KPIs.

If we don't have confidence in the MVC or what success looks like, we should continue validation cycles before we move to the Build track.

### Validation phase 1: Validation backlog

<i class="fab fa-gitlab fa-fw" style="color:rgb(252,109,38); font-size:1.25em" aria-hidden="true"></i> Label: `workflow::validation backlog`

#### Description

The growth of a world class product is built from a well maintained backlog. Product Managers are responsible for refining a group's backlog to ensure validation opportunities are scoped and [prioritized](/handbook/product/product-processes/#prioritization) in line with category direction, stage, and/or section level strategy. The backlog is also the single source of truth for [stakeholders](/handbook/product/product-processes/#what-is-a-stakeholder) to understand and engage with your group. An issue position in the backlog, along with the description, discussion, and metadata on those issues are key pieces of data necessary to keep stakeholders up to date.

#### Outcomes and Activities

| Outcomes | Activities |
|----------|------------|
| <i aria-hidden="true" style="color:rgb(252,109,38); font-size:1.25em" class="fab fa-gitlab fa-fw"></i>**Up to date issues and epics**: At GitLab, issues are the single source of truth for any change to the product. Keeping these up to date increases efficiency and transparency by allowing all team members to understand the planned work. | - Create issues in response to a [sensing mechanism](/handbook/product/product-processes/sensing-mechanisms/). Consider using the *Problem Validation* issue template for new features. <br/>- Review issue discussions and update relevant info in the description. <br/>- Keep metadata (such as labels) up-to-date. <br/>- Actively respond to stakeholder comments. <br/>- Transfer discussion notes, and external information to the issue (as links or discussion/description details). |
| <i class="fab fa-gitlab fa-fw" style="color:rgb(252,109,38); font-size:1.25em" aria-hidden="true"></i>[**Prioritized backlog**](/handbook/product-development/programs/backlog/): The issue and epic backlog is the primary signal stakeholders use to know what's "up next" for a group. The backlog is also the queue for a group to work from, as features progress through the Product Development Flow phases. This queue is kept up to date with milestones and rank ordering on issue boards. | - Regular review of issue prioritization (such as issue board ordering and milestone assignment). <br/>- Align prioritized backlog to category direction and category maturity state. <br/>- Consider using the [RICE formula](https://www.productplan.com/glossary/rice-scoring-model/) to help make prioritization tradeoffs.<br/>- Consider holding [prioritization sessions](/handbook/product/product-processes/#prioritization-sessions) to collect priority feedback from stable counterparts as there are [other DRIs for bug and maintenance work](/handbook/product/product-processes/). |

### Validation phase 2: Problem validation

<i class="fab fa-gitlab fa-fw" style="color:rgb(252,109,38); font-size:1.25em" aria-hidden="true"></i> Label: `workflow::problem validation`

#### Description

To ensure the right solutions are delivered, the team must start their work with a [validated problem](/handbook/product/ux/ux-research/problem-validation-and-methods). This can take [many forms](/handbook/product/ux/ux-research/problem-validation-and-methods/#foundational-research-methods).

If the problem is documented and well-understood, it may be possible to quickly move through this phase by documenting the known data about the user problem. A documented problem can be categorized as a pre-existing experience from feedback directly from users or an issue that has user engagement confirming that the problem is experienced by multiple users. A well-understood problem can be one that has a series of documented qualitative research from customer interviews, triangulating [different sensing mechanisms](/handbook/product/product-processes/sensing-mechanisms/) confirming the problem, or using known data. Some examples of known data include [Customer Request Issues](https://10az.online.tableau.com/#/site/gitlab/workbooks/2015827/views) or pre-existing [`Actionable Insights`](/handbook/product/ux/ux-research/research-insights/#how-to-document-actionable-insights) from prior research. To document that a problem is well-understood, link the known data and any customer calls to the relevant issues and epics.

If the problem is nuanced or not yet well understood, then it will likely take longer to validate with users properly. This phase's primary outcome is a clear understanding of the problem, along with a simple and clear way to communicate the problem to various stakeholders. Although optional, it is recommended to use an [Opportunity Canvas](/handbook/product/product-processes/#opportunity-canvas) as a tool that helps individuals better understand a problem, and communicate it to various stakeholders. An Opportunity Canvas can also be used to recommend creation of a new category including asking for new resourcing.

#### Outcomes and Activities

| Outcomes | Activities |
|----------|------------|
| <i class="fab fa-gitlab fa-fw" style="color:rgb(252,109,38); font-size:1.25em" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Thorough understanding of the problem**: The team understands the problem, who it affects, when and why, and how solving the problem maps to business needs and product strategy. | - Create an issue using the [Problem Validation Template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/Problem%20Validation.md) in the GitLab project. <br/>- Complete an [Opportunity Canvas](/handbook/product/product-processes/#opportunity-canvas). <br/>- Schedule a review of the opportunity canvas for feedback. <br/>- Create an issue using the [Problem Validation Research Template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ux-research/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/Problem%20validation.md) in the UX Research project and work with UX Researcher to execute the research study. <br/>- Validate your problem with users using any of the [proposed methods](/handbook/product/ux/ux-research/problem-validation-and-methods/) and [document your findings in Dovetail](/handbook/product/ux/dovetail/). |
| <i class="fab fa-gitlab fa-fw" style="color:rgb(252,109,38); font-size:1.25em" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Update issue/epic description**: A well understood and clearly articulated customer problem is added to the issue, and will lead to successful and efficient design and development phases. | - Ensure your issue is up-to-date with the latest understanding of the problem. <br/>- Understand and document (in the issue) the goals that people want to accomplish using the [Jobs to be Done (JTBD)](/handbook/product/ux/jobs-to-be-done/) framework. <br/>- Conduct [continuous interviews](/handbook/product/product-processes/continuous-interviewing/) with customers on a regular cadence to stay up-to-date on the problems that users face. <br/>- Leverage your [opportunity canvas](/handbook/product/product-processes/#opportunity-canvas) to communicate the problem to your stable counterparts and group stakeholders. Consider scheduling a review to gather feedback and communicate the findings to Product and UX leadership.<br/>- Confirm that the Product Designer understands the problem well enough to ideate on solutions. |
| Initiate the Dogfooding Process: When validating problems, it's important to gather feedback from [internal customers](/handbook/product/product-processes/#engage-with-internal-customers), in addition to the broader community. Capturing internal customer feedback early on in the product development flow helps ensure their needs are considered as the feature matures, accelerating key [Dogfooding](/handbook/product/product-processes/dogfooding-for-r-d/) outcomes. Driving internal usage of features consistently [leads to greater customer adoption](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2020/04/16/geo-is-available-on-staging-for-gitlab-com/) and is required for [viable maturity](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/#maturity). | - Open [Dogfooding issues](/handbook/product/product-processes/dogfooding-for-r-d/) during the validation phase and capture internal customer feedback to help inform initial and/or future iterations of a feature. |

### Validation phase 3: Design

<i class="fab fa-gitlab fa-fw" style="color:rgb(252,109,38); font-size:1.25em" aria-hidden="true"></i> Labels: `workflow::design`

#### Description

After understanding and validating the problem, we can begin or continue to ideate potential solutions through a [diverge/converge](https://web.archive.org/web/20210119060603/https://web.stanford.edu/~rldavis/educ236/readings/doet/text/ch06_excerpt.html) process. However, if the outcome from the problem validation phase confidently suggests an incremental modification to the existing solution, the aforementioned diverge/converge process could be skipped.

This phase involves ideating potential solutions and exploring different approaches (diverge) before converging on a single solution. Solutions are evaluated by determining if they meet customer and business goals, are technically feasible, and align with legal compliance considerations. The team is encouraged to engage with stakeholders to determine potential flaws, missed use cases, potential security risks, and if the solution has the intended customer impact.

THe DRI is responsible for reviewing the [Legal Risk Checklist](https://internal.gitlab.com/handbook/legal-and-corporate-affairs/legal-and-compliance/legal-risk-checklist/) (accessible to team members only) and determining whether any sections need to be completed. After the team converges on the proposed solution or identifies a small set of options to validate, the issue moves into the Solution Validation phase.

To start the Design phase, apply the `workflow::design` label to an existing issue or, if needed, creates a new issue with this label.

#### Outcomes and Activities

|----------|------------|
|<i class="fab fa-gitlab fa-fw" style="color:rgb(252,109,38); font-size:1.25em" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Proposed solution(s) identified and documented**: The DRI works with the team to explore solutions and identifies the approach(es) that strike the best balance of user experience, customer value, business value, and development cost. | The DRI optionally applies the `workflow::ready for design` label to the issue, signaling the design backlog of next issues to be done is prioritized. <br/> <br/> **Diverge**: explore multiple different approaches as a team. Example activities: <br/>- [Think Big](/handbook/product/ux/thinkbig/) session. <br/>Internal interviews (be sure to [document findings in Dovetail](/handbook/product/ux/dovetail/)). <br/> - Creating [user flows](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/what-are-user-flows/). <br/><br/>  **Converge**: identify a small set of options to validate. Example activities:<br/> - [Think Small](/handbook/product/ux/thinkbig/#think-small) session with the team.<br/> - Design reviews with team<br/> - Low fidelity design ideas. <br/> - Update issue/epic description with proposed solution. Add Figma design file link or attach design to [GitLab's Design Management](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issues/design_management.html) to communicate the solution idea. Read to understand [what tool to use](/handbook/product/ux/product-designer/#delivering-your-solution). <br/> - Validate approach with help from stakeholders. Run user validation using any of the [proposed methods](/handbook/product/ux/ux-research/solution-validation-and-methods/) and [document your findings in Dovetail](/handbook/product/ux/dovetail/) and appropriate GitLab issue. <br/> - Draw inspiration from competitive and adjacent offerings. |
|<i class="fab fa-gitlab fa-fw" style="color:rgb(252,109,38); font-size:1.25em" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Shared understanding in the team of the proposed solution**: The DRI leads the broader team through a review of the proposed solution(s). | - Review the proposed solution as a team so that everyone has a chance to contribute, ask questions, raise concerns, and suggest alternatives. <br/>- Review the proposed solution with leadership. |
|<i class="fab fa-gitlab fa-fw" style="color:rgb(252,109,38); font-size:1.25em" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Confidence in the technical feasibility**: It's important that Engineering understands the technical feasibility of the solution(s) to avoid rework or significant changes when we start the build phase. | - Discuss the technical implications with Engineering to ensure that what is being proposed is possible within the desired timeframe. When sharing design work, use both Figma's collaboration tools and GitLab's design management features. Read to understand [what tool to use](/handbook/product/ux/product-designer/#delivering-your-solution). <br/>- Engage engineering peers early and often through Slack messages, pings on issues or by scheduling sessions to discuss the proposal.<br>- If the solution is large and complex, consider scheduling a [spike](/handbook/product/product-processes/#spikes) to mitigate risks and uncover the optimal iteration path. |
|<i class="fab fa-gitlab fa-fw" style="color:rgb(252,109,38); font-size:1.25em" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Updated issues/epic descriptions**: The DRI ensures issues and epics are up-to-date. | - Ensure issues and epics are up-to-date, so we can continue our work efficiently and asynchronously. <br/>- [Experiment definition](/handbook/engineering/development/growth/#experimentation). |
|Continue Dogfooding process | - If applicable to their feature, the DRI continues the Dogfooding process by deciding whether to [build the feature in GitLab or keep outside](/handbook/product/product-processes/dogfooding-for-r-d/) the product. |

### Validation phase 4: Solution Validation

<i class="fab fa-gitlab fa-fw" style="color:rgb(252,109,38); font-size:1.25em" aria-hidden="true"></i> Label: <code>workflow::solution validation</code>

#### Description

After identifying one or more potential solutions that meet business requirements and are technically feasible, the DRI must ensure that we have confidence that the proposed solution will meet the user's needs and expectations. This confidence can be obtained from work performed during the design phase and supplemented with additional research (including user interviews, usability testing, or solution validation). If necessary, this phase will launch a Solution Validation issue within the [GitLab UX Research project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ux-research) which will walk the team through research to validate their proposed solution(s).

In addition, any [non-functional requirements](/handbook/product/product-processes/#foundational-requirements) for the feature need to be considered and documented. These include such things as evaluating whether or not [application limits](/handbook/product/product-processes/#introducing-application-limits) need to be introduced, or any [considerations around data storage](/handbook/product/product-processes/#considerations-around-data-storage) should be evaluated. Defining these non-functional requirements up front ensures we are considering scalability and the long-term success of the feature. Sensible default values should be identified at this stage which align with the long-term vision for the feature.

To start the Solution Validation phase, the DRI applies the `workflow::solution validation` label to an existing issue.

## Build track

The build track is where we plan, develop, and deliver value to our users by building [MVCs](/handbook/product/product-principles/#the-minimal-valuable-change-mvc), fixing defects, patching security vulnerabilities, enhancing user experience, and improving performance. This track is also a time [when we get insight into whether we are creating the right thing](/handbook/product/ux/ux-research/when-to-conduct-ux-research/#design-things-rightsolution-validation) for our users. The team works closely together to implement MVCs. Decisions are made quickly if challenges arise. We instrument [usage](https://internal.gitlab.com/handbook/company/performance-indicators/product/#instrument-tracking) and track [product performance](https://internal.gitlab.com/handbook/company/performance-indicators/product/), so after MVCs are delivered to customers, feedback is captured quickly for learnings to [refine the next iteration](/handbook/product/product-processes/#iteration-strategies). For an example of how to leverage GitLab's various features to create a focused and collaborative board to flow through the Build track, [check out this video](https://youtu.be/rZW0ou4u-dw).

### Build Goals & Outcomes

**When:** As we build MVCs according to our [product development timeline](/handbook/engineering/workflow/#product-development-timeline)

**Who:** Product Manager, Product Designer, Development team, Software Engineer in Test

**What:**

✅ **Release** to a subset or full set of customers as appropriate.

✅ **Assess** UX, functional, technical performance, and customer impact.

✅ **Collect** data to measure MVC against success metrics to inform the next iteration.

✅ **Iterate** until success metrics are achieved and the product experience is optimal.

**Outcome:** Deliver performant MVCs that improve one or more of our [Product KPIs](https://internal.gitlab.com/handbook/company/performance-indicators/product/) and/or [Engineering KPIs](/handbook/company/kpis/#engineering-kpis). If it fails to do so, honor our Efficiency value (that includes a low level of shame), abandon it, and restart the validation cycle to identify the right solution.

|-------|-------|
|<i class="fab fa-gitlab fa-fw" style="color:rgb(252,109,38); font-size:1.25em" aria-hidden="true"></i> `workflow::planning breakdown` | Applied by the DRI on or before the [4th of the month](/handbook/engineering/workflow/#product-development-timeline) signaling an intent to prioritize the issue for the next milestone. |
|<i class="fab fa-gitlab fa-fw" style="color:rgb(252,109,38); font-size:1.25em" aria-hidden="true"></i> `workflow::ready for development` | Issue has been broken down and prioritized for development. Issue also has a [work type classification](/handbook/product/groups/product-analysis/engineering/metrics/#work-type-classification) (`type::`) label and milestone assigned at this point. |
|<i class="fab fa-gitlab fa-fw" style="color:rgb(252,109,38); font-size:1.25em" aria-hidden="true"></i> `Deliverable` | Applied to issues by DRI indicating it's been accepted into the current milestone. |

#### Description

This phase prepares features so they are ready to be built by engineering. Bugs, technical debt, and other similar changes that are not features may enter the process in this phase (or may benefit from entering in earlier phases based on the cost of doing the work requiring the full problem to be validated to ensure it makes sense to do the work). Following Validation Phase 4 the feature should already be broken down into the quickest change possible to improve the user's outcome and be ready for a more detailed review by engineering. During this phase, the DRI will surface issues they intend to prioritize for a milestone by applying the `workflow::planning breakdown` label. At this point, the appropriate DRI will assign an engineer to further break down and apply weights to that work. Tradeoff decisions can be made and feature issues evolve from validation solutions to clear MVCs that can be delivered in a single milestone. Be sure to document all decisions on issues.

During this phase, the DRI must revisit the [Legal Risk Checklist](https://internal.gitlab.com/handbook/legal-and-corporate-affairs/legal-and-compliance/legal-risk-checklist/) (accessible to team members only) to make sure none of their previous determinations during Validation phase 3: Design need revision.

By reviewing and weighing work in the beginning of the Build Track, the DRI is able to make better prioritization tradeoffs and engineering teams can ensure they've scoped the right amount of work for the milestone. If an issue enters the `workflow::planning breakdown` state it doesn't necessarily mean it will be prioritized in the next milestone, the DRI may make a tradeoff decision depending on capacity, and urgency.

Once work has passed the `workflow::planning breakdown` step, the `workflow::ready for development`, `type::` labels along with an upcoming milestone are applied to the issue. If an issue has been broken down, but not yet ready to pull into a milestone you may optionally apply the `workflow::scheduling` label; however, in this state any issue that has the `workflow::ready for development` label without a milestone has an implied status of "waiting to be scheduled". The DRI will apply `Deliverable` label to issues with a milestone and marked `workflow::ready for development` signaling acceptance of the issue for that milestone. This process occurs at the [beginning of milestone planning](/handbook/engineering/workflow/#product-development-timeline).

During this phase, it's important to keep Application Security Engineers informed to ensure that they have visibility into planning schedule. This provides them with sufficient time for planning dynamic testing so they can keep the product manager and development team informed of any time/resource requirements.

#### Description

The develop and test phase is where we build the features, address bugs or technical debt and test the solutions before launching them. The DRI is directly responsible for [overall prioritization](/handbook/product/product-processes/) of a milestone, including bugs and maintenance work; however, the Engineering team is responsible for the implementation using the [engineering workflow](/handbook/engineering/workflow/#basics). Engineering owns the [definition of done](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/contributing/merge_request_workflow.html#definition-of-done) and issues are not moved into the next phase until those requirements are met. Keep in mind that many team members are likely to contribute to a single issue and collaboration is key.

This phase begins after work has been broken down, and [prioritized](/handbook/product/product-processes/) in Phase 1. Work is completed in priority order as set at the beginning of the milestone. The DRI will assign an issue to an engineer who is responsible for building the feature or addressing a bug or maintenance issue. An engineer can also self-serve and pick up the next priority order issue from the `workflow::ready for development` queue on their team's board. That engineer will update its `workflow::` label to indicate where it's position in the [development process](/handbook/engineering/workflow/#basics).

When an issue is in `workflow::in review`, the Application Security Engineer would help validate the risk mitigations through the non-blocking [application security review process](/handbook/security/product-security/application-security/appsec-reviews/).

Documentation for the work will be developed by the engineer and the Technical Writer (see [Documentation with code as a workflow](https://docs.gitlab.com/development/documentation/workflow/#documentation-with-code-as-a-workflow)). The Technical Writer should review the documentation as part of the development process. Items discovered during a documentation review should not block issues moving into the next phase. This may drive the creation of follow-on improvement MRs for the documentation, after release.

After the feature code has been merged, the issue should be moved to `workflow::verification`.
When an issue is in `workflow::verification`, the responsible engineer will [manually test the feature](/handbook/engineering/#manual-verification) in either the Staging or Production environment.

*Note: Work deemed out-of-scope or incomplete by engineering is taken back into the [plan phase](#build-phase-1-plan) for refinement and rescheduling for completion.*

### Build phase 3: Launch

Issue Status: `Closed`

#### Required Labels

| Label | Usage |
|-------|-------|
|<i class="fab fa-gitlab fa-fw" style="color:rgb(252,109,38); font-size:1.25em" aria-hidden="true"></i> `workflow::complete` | Applied after the feature is deployed to production, any needed verification is complete, and the issue has been closed. |

#### Description

When the change becomes available in production and any needed verification is complete, the issue is closed and the `workflow::complete` label is added so stakeholders know work on it has been completed. Afterward, the DRI coordinates the [release post](/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/) and [dogfooding process](/handbook/product/product-processes/dogfooding-for-r-d/) when they apply.

|Continue Dogfooding process | - If the DRI wants to dogfood the feature and it's ready for internal consumption, the DRI [promotes it internally](/handbook/product/product-processes/dogfooding-for-r-d/). |
| Experiment results and follow-up issue is created | For experiments, create a [follow-up issue](/handbook/engineering/development/growth/experimentation/#experiment-status) that will be where results of the test and next-steps are tracked. |

### Build phase 4: Improve

Label: n/a

#### Description

After launch, the DRI should pay close attention to product usage data. This starts by ensuring your [AMAU](https://internal.gitlab.com/handbook/company/performance-indicators/product/#action-monthly-active-users-amau) is instrumented and reporting as you expect. From there consider how the feature has impacted [GMAU](https://internal.gitlab.com/handbook/company/performance-indicators/product/#group-monthly-active-users-gmau) and [SMAU](https://internal.gitlab.com/handbook/company/performance-indicators/product/#stage-monthly-active-users-smau). At this point you should also solicit customer feedback to guide follow-on iterative improvements, until success metrics are achieved/exceeded and a decision can be made that the product experience is sufficient. To create a combined and ongoing quantitative and qualitative feedback loop, consideration of the outcomes and potential activities below are recommended.

#### Outcomes and Activities

|----------|------------|
|<i class="fab fa-gitlab fa-fw" style="color:rgb(252,109,38); font-size:1.25em" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Understand Qualitative Feedback**: To know how to improve something, it's important to understand the qualitative feedback that we're hearing from users and team members. | - Create a dedicated [feedback issue](/handbook/product/product-principles/#feedback-issues) (optional). <br>- Continue [dogfooding process](/handbook/product/product-processes/dogfooding-for-r-d/). <br/>- Review [user feedback in issues](/handbook/product/product-principles/#feedback-issues). <br/>- Follow up with [CSMs](/job-families/sales/customer-success-management/) and [SAEs](/job-families/sales/enterprise-account-executive/) to gather feedback from interested customers. <br/>- Set up follow-up calls with customers to gather more specific feedback. <br/>- Consider running a [Category Maturity Scorecard](/handbook/product/ux/category-maturity/category-maturity-scorecards/) evaluation. <br/>- Consider running a survey for usability. |

## Release stages guidelines

Teams should release features as generally available from the start unless there are strong reasons to release them as experimental, beta, or limited availability first.

Product development teams should refrain from making changes that they believe
could create significant risks or friction for GitLab users or the platform, such as:

- Risking damage or exfiltration of existing production data accessed by our users.
- Destabilizing other parts of the application.
- Introducing friction into high Monthly Active User (MAU) areas.

### Experiment features

In addition to the [experiment details](https://docs.gitlab.com/policy/development_stages_support/#experiment) for users, experiments:

- Are not by default a “scope” or feature-set, nor a “maturity” level or quality bar.
- Are a tool project leads can use to validate their feature, most commonly to validate the **problem**.
- Are not required, can be skipped and indeed should be skipped if the problem is already validated, for example via user research or other methods.
- Shouldn’t be used as a way to get feedback on something that is broken.
- Shouldn’t be used to release a feature early.
- Not all experiments are expected to become GA.
- experiments should follow the scientific method and use a templated structure.
- Have a testable hypothesis you need an answer to with clear success/failure criteria defined in advance.
  - Design an experiment that has the ability to test that hypothesis.
  - Run the experiment for the shortest possible time period.
  - Report the results of the experiment (even if it’s just a few lines).
  - Decide if the experiment was successful or not and next steps.
  - Should ideally last only 1-2 milestones.
- TODO: [DRI needed] Telemetry requirements should be added or linked to here.
- TODO: [DRI needed] UX requirements for experiment should be added or linked to here.
- TODO: [DRI needed] Engineering requirements for experiment should be added or linked to here.
- Offer a way to opt in with minimal friction.
- Link out to the [GitLab Testing Agreement](/handbook/legal/testing-agreement/) in the opt-in.
- Have documentation that reflects that the feature is subject to the [GitLab Testing Agreement](/handbook/legal/testing-agreement/).
- Have [UI that reflects the experiment status](https://design.gitlab.com/usability/feature-management/#highlighting-feature-versions).
- Have a feedback issue to engage with internal and external users.
- Not be announced in a release post.
- Be promoted in the user interface through [discovery moments](https://design.gitlab.com/usability/feature-management/#discovery-moments),
  if needed.

All experimental features that [meet the review criteria](/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/production/readiness/#criteria-for-starting-a-production-readiness-review)
must [initiate Production Readiness Review](/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/production/readiness/#process)
and complete the [experiment section in the readiness template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/readiness/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/production_readiness.md#experiment).

### Beta features

In addition to the [beta details](https://docs.gitlab.com/policy/development_stages_support/#beta) for users, beta features:

- Are not by default a “scope” or feature-set, nor a “maturity” level or quality bar.
- Are a tool project leads can use to validate their feature, most commonly to validate the solution.
- Should be used when the problem is already validated and we have confidence in the solution but want to verify with customers.
- Are not required, and can be skipped.
- Shouldn’t be used as a way to get feedback on something that is broken.
- Shouldn’t be used to release a feature early.
- Have a high likelihood of becoming GA.
- Project leads should consider using the CAB, EAP to recruit beta users.
- Project leads should consider how external contributors can participate in betas.
- Project leads running betas should define beta exit criteria, ideally before work begins and after discussion with UX and Engineering.
- TODO: [DRI needed] Telemetry requirements should be added or linked to here.
- TODO: [DRI needed] UX requirements for beta should be added or linked to here.
- TODO: [DRI needed] Engineering requirements for beta should be added or linked to here.
- Have documentation that reflects the beta status.
- Have [UI that reflects the beta status](https://design.gitlab.com/usability/feature-management/#highlighting-feature-versions).
- Have a feedback issue to engage with internal and external users.
- Be announced in a release post that reflects the beta status, if desired.
- Be promoted in the user interface through [discovery moments](https://design.gitlab.com/usability/feature-management/#discovery-moments),
  if needed.

All beta features that [meet the review criteria](/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/production/readiness/#criteria-for-starting-a-production-readiness-review)

### Provide earlier access

Our [mission is "everyone can contribute"](/handbook/company/mission/),
and that is only possible if people outside the company can try a feature. We get higher quality (more diverse) feedback
if people from different organizations try something, so give users the ability to opt in to experimental
features when there is enough value.

Where possible, release an experimental feature externally instead of only testing internally
or waiting for the feature to be in a beta state. We've learned that keeping features internal-only
for extended periods of time slows us down unnecessarily.

Experimental features are only shown when people/organizations opt in to experiments,
so we are allowed to make mistakes here and literally experiment.

### Experiment and beta exit criteria

To ensure the phases before general availability are as short as possible each phase of experiment,
beta, and limited availability should include exit criteria. This encourages rapid iteration and
reduces [cycle time](/handbook/values/#reduce-cycle-time).

GitLab Product Managers must take the following into account when deciding what exit criteria
to apply to their experimental and beta features:

- **Time**: Define an end date at which point the feature will be generally available.
  - Consider setting a time-bound target metric that will define readiness for exit into general availability.
    For example, X number of customers retained MoM over 6 months after launch of experiment,
    X% growth of free and paid users in three months since launch beta, or similar.
  - Be mindful of balancing time to market, user experience, and richness of experience.
    Some beta programs have lasted one milestone while others have lasted a couple of years.
- **Feedback**: Define the minimum number of customers that have been onboarded and interviewed.
  - Consider also setting a time bound when using user feedback as an exit criteria for leaving a phase.
    If a given time period elapses and we can not solicit feedback from enough users,
    it is better to ship what we have and iterate on it as generally available at that point rather than maintain a pre-general availability state.
- **Limited Feature Completion**: Determine if there is functionality that should be completed before moving to general availability.
  - Be wary of including "just one more" feature. Iteration is easier and more effective with more feedback from more users,
    so getting to general availability is preferred.
- **System Performance metrics**: Determine the criteria that the platform has shown before being ready for general availability.
  Examples include response times and successfully handling a specific number of requests per second.
- **Success criteria**: Not all features will be generally available. It is OK to pivot if early feedback indicates that
  a different direction would provide more value or a better user experience. If open questions must be answered
  to decide if the feature is worth putting in the product, list and answer those.

For the exit criteria of **AI features**, in addition to the above, see the [UX maturity requirements](/handbook/product/ai/ux-maturity/).

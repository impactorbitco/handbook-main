- Defining and achieving quality objectives

## 0. Introduction

### 0.1 General

Adopting a Quality Management System (QMS) is a strategic decision that enhances organizational performance, customer satisfaction, and sustainable development outcomes.

**Potential benefits of implementing this QMS include:**

- Consistently providing products and services that meet customer, statutory, and regulatory requirements  
- Enhancing customer satisfaction and trust  
- Proactively addressing risks and opportunities related to organizational context and objectives  
- Demonstrating conformity to ISO 9001:2015 requirements

This QMS is applicable to both internal and external parties. It is designed to be flexible, without enforcing uniform documentation structure or terminology, while supporting innovation, breakthrough improvements, and organizational adaptability to dynamic customer and market requirements.

The system uses a **process approach**, integrating:

- **Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle** to ensure continual improvement  
- **Risk-based thinking** to identify, prevent, and leverage potential outcomes  

**Verbal forms used in this document:**

- **shall** – requirement  
- **should** – recommendation  
- **may** – permission  
- **can** – possibility or capability  

**NOTE:** Guidance notes provide clarification without imposing mandatory actions.

### 0.2 Quality Management Principles

This QMS is based on the **ISO 9000 quality management principles**, which provide a foundation for organizational performance and continual improvement:

1. **Customer focus** – understanding and meeting customer needs  
2. **Leadership** – establishing purpose, direction, and engagement  
3. **Engagement of people** – fostering competence, empowerment, and involvement  
4. **Process approach** – managing interrelated activities as processes  
5. **Improvement** – continual enhancement of performance  
6. **Evidence-based decision making** – informed, data-driven decisions  
7. **Relationship management** – maintaining mutually beneficial stakeholder relationships

### 0.3 Process Approach

#### 0.3.1 General

The QMS adopts a **process approach** to manage interrelated activities systematically. This approach enhances effectiveness, consistency, and efficiency, while delivering customer satisfaction.

**Benefits of the process approach include:**

- Clear understanding of requirements and responsibilities  
- Focus on value creation  
- Effective performance measurement and evaluation  
- Continuous improvement based on data and results  

#### 0.3.2 Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) Cycle

The **PDCA cycle** applies to all processes and the QMS as a whole:

- **Plan** – define objectives, resource requirements, and risks/opportunities  
- **Do** – implement the planned activities and controls  
- **Check** – monitor performance, measure results, and report deviations  
- **Act** – take corrective and improvement actions  

#### 0.3.3 Risk-Based Thinking

Risk-based thinking is embedded throughout the QMS to:

- Identify potential deviations and nonconformities  
- Establish preventive and corrective measures  
- Maximise opportunities while mitigating negative impacts  

Opportunities may arise from favorable situations, innovation, efficiency improvements, or strategic changes, and are considered alongside associated risks.

### 0.4 Relationship with Other Management System Standards

This QMS aligns with ISO frameworks to support integration with other management systems:

- **ISO 9000** – Fundamentals and vocabulary  
- **ISO 9004** – Guidance for sustained success and continual improvement  

It also supports compatibility with sector-specific QMS standards. It does **not** include requirements specific to environmental, occupational health & safety, or financial management systems, although it can be integrated with such systems where relevant.

# **Introduction**

An OHSMS is typically designed to be compatible with the ISO 45001 standard, which provides a framework for the development and implementation of an OHSMS.

**0.1 Background**

An organization is responsible for the occupational health and safety of workers and others who can be affected by its activities. This responsibility includes promoting and protecting their physical and mental health.

The adoption of an OH&S management system is intended to enable an organization to provide safe and healthy workplaces, prevent work-related injury and ill health, and continually improve its OH&S performance.

**0.2 Aim of an OH&S management system**

The purpose of an OH&S management system is to provide a framework for managing OH&S risks and opportunities. The aim and intended outcomes of the OH&S management system are to prevent work-related injury and ill health to workers and to provide safe and healthy workplaces; consequently, it is critically important for the organization to eliminate hazards and minimize OH&S risks by taking effective preventive and protective measures.

When these measures are applied by the organization through its OH&S management system, they improve its OH&S performance. An OH&S management system can be more effective and efficient when taking early action to address opportunities for improvement of OH&S performance.

Implementing an OH&S management system conforming to this document enables an organization to manage its OH&S risks and improve its OH&S performance. An OH&S management system can assist an organization to fulfil its legal requirements and other requirements.

**0.3 Success factors**

The implementation of an OH&S management system is a strategic and operational decision for an organization. The success of the OH&S management system depends on leadership, commitment and participation from all levels and functions of the organization.

The implementation and maintenance of an OH&S management system, its effectiveness and its ability to achieve its intended outcomes are dependent on a number of key factors, which can include:

- a) top management leadership, commitment, responsibilities and accountability;
- b) top management developing, leading and promoting a culture in the organization that supports the intended outcomes of the OH&S management system;
- c) communication;
- d) consultation and participation of workers, and, where they exist, workers’ representatives;
- e) allocation of the necessary resources to maintain it;
- f) OH&S policies, which are compatible with the overall strategic objectives and direction of the organization;
- g) effective process(es) for identifying hazards, controlling OH&S risks and taking advantage of OH&S opportunities;
- h) continual performance evaluation and monitoring of the OH&S management system to improve OH&S performance;
- i) integration of the OH&S management system into the organization’s business processes;
- j) OH&S objectives that align with the OH&S policy and take into account the organization’s hazards, OH&S risks and OH&S opportunities;
- k) compliance with its legal requirements and other requirements.

Demonstration of successful implementation of this document can be used by an organization to give assurance to workers and other interested parties that an effective OH&S management system is in place. Adoption of this document, however, will not in itself guarantee prevention of work-related injury and ill health to workers, provision of safe and healthy workplaces and improved OH&S performance.

The level of detail, the complexity, the extent of documented information and the resources needed to ensure the success of an organization’s OH&S management system will depend on a number of factors, such as:

- — the organization’s context (e.g. number of workers, size, geography, culture, legal requirements and other requirements);
- — the scope of the organization’s OH&S management system;
- — the nature of the organization’s activities and the related OH&S risks.

**0.4 Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle**

The OH&S management system approach applied in this document is founded on the concept of Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA).

The PDCA concept is an iterative process used by organizations to achieve continual improvement. It can be applied to a management system and to each of its individual elements, as follows:

- a) Plan: determine and assess OH&S risks, OH&S opportunities and other risks and other opportunities, establish OH&S objectives and processes necessary to deliver results in accordance with the organization’s OH&S policy;
- b) Do: implement the processes as planned;
- c) Check: monitor and measure activities and processes with regard to the OH&S policy and OH&S objectives, and report the results;
- d) Act: take actions to continually improve the OH&S performance to achieve the intended outcomes.

This document incorporates the PDCA concept into a new framework, as shown in [Figure 1](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/en/#iso:std:iso:45001:ed-1:v1:en:fig:1).

systematic, independent and documented [*process* (3.25)](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/en/#iso:std:iso:45001:ed-1:v1:en:term:3.25) for obtaining audit evidence and evaluating it objectively to determine the extent to which the audit criteria are fulfilled

Note 1 to entry: An audit can be an internal audit (first party) or an external audit (second party or third party), and it can be a combined audit (combining two or more disciplines).

Note 2 to entry: An internal audit is conducted by the [*organization* (3.1)](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/en/#iso:std:iso:45001:ed-1:v1:en:term:3.1) itself, or by an external party on its behalf.

Note 3 to entry: “Audit evidence” and “audit criteria” are defined in ISO 19011.

Note 4 to entry: This constitutes one of the common terms and core definitions for ISO management system standards given in Annex SL of the Consolidated ISO Supplement to the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 1.

**3.33 conformity**

fulfilment of a [*requirement* (3.8)](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/en/#iso:std:iso:45001:ed-1:v1:en:term:3.8)

Note 1 to entry: Nonconformity relates to requirements in this document and additional [*OH&S management system* (3.11)](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/en/#iso:std:iso:45001:ed-1:v1:en:term:3.11) requirements that an [*organization* (3.1)](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/en/#iso:std:iso:45001:ed-1:v1:en:term:3.1) establishes for itself.

Note 2 to entry: This constitutes one of the common terms and core definitions for ISO management system standards given in Annex SL of the Consolidated ISO Supplement to the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 1. Note 1 to entry has been added to clarify the relationship of nonconformities to the requirements of this document and to the organization’s own requirements for its OH&S management system.

**3.35 incident**

occurrence arising out of, or in the course of, work that could or does result in [*injury and ill health* (3.18)](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/en/#iso:std:iso:45001:ed-1:v1:en:term:3.18)

Note 1 to entry: An incident where injury and ill health occurs is sometimes referred to as an “accident”.

Note 2 to entry: An incident where no injury and ill health occurs, but has the potential to do so, may be referred to as a “near-miss”, “near-hit” or “close call”.

Note 3 to entry: Although there can be one or more [*nonconformities* (3.34)](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/en/#iso:std:iso:45001:ed-1:v1:en:term:3.34) related to an incident, an incident can also occur where there is no nonconformity.

**3.36 corrective action**

action to eliminate the cause(s) of a [*nonconformity* (3.34)](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/en/#iso:std:iso:45001:ed-1:v1:en:term:3.34) or an [*incident* (3.35)](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/en/#iso:std:iso:45001:ed-1:v1:en:term:3.35) and to prevent recurrence

Note 1 to entry: This constitutes one of the common terms and core definitions for ISO management system standards given in Annex SL of the Consolidated ISO Supplement to the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 1. The definition has been modified to include reference to “incident”, as incidents are a key factor in occupational health and safety, yet the activities needed for resolving them are the same as for nonconformities, through corrective action.

**3.37 continual improvement**

recurring activity to enhance [*performance* (3.27)](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/en/#iso:std:iso:45001:ed-1:v1:en:term:3.27)

Note 1 to entry: Enhancing performance relates to the use of the [*OH&S management system* (3.11)](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/en/#iso:std:iso:45001:ed-1:v1:en:term:3.11) in order to achieve improvement in overall [*OH&S performance* (3.28)](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/en/#iso:std:iso:45001:ed-1:v1:en:term:3.28) consistent with the [*OH&S policy* (3.15)](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/en/#iso:std:iso:45001:ed-1:v1:en:term:3.15) and [*OH&S objectives* (3.17)](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/en/#iso:std:iso:45001:ed-1:v1:en:term:3.17).

Note 2 to entry: Continual does not mean continuous, so the activity does not need to take place in all areas simultaneously.

Note 3 to entry: This constitutes one of the common terms and core definitions for ISO management system standards given in Annex SL of the Consolidated ISO Supplement to the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 1. Note 1 to entry has been added to clarify the meaning of “performance” in the context of an OH&S management system; Note 2 to entry has been added to clarify the meaning of “continual”.

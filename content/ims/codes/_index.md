## Introduction

The Impact Orbit Creative Group Handbook serves as the central guide for how we operate, make decisions, and maintain our standards across all divisions.  

It consolidates policies, best practices, and procedural guidance to ensure consistency, accountability, and ethical conduct throughout the organisation.

Much of the handbook is [open to the world](https://github.com/impactorbitco/handbook-main) in the spirit of transparency.  

We encourage feedback — submit a [pull request](https://github.com/impactorbitco/handbook-main) to suggest improvements or clarifications, or open an issue for questions.

For information that is sensitive or internal-only, we maintain a separate **Internal Handbook**.

## Core Codes and Policies

Impact Orbit Creative Group operates under a framework of key codes and conduct standards that guide the behaviour of all employees, contractors, and partners. These include:

- [**Code of Ethics**](code-of-ethics) – Outlines the principles, values, and ethical standards expected of all personnel.  
- [**Code of Confidentiality**](code-of-confidentiality) – Defines responsibilities for safeguarding sensitive company, client, and partner information.  
- [**Employee Code of Conduct**](employee-code-of-conduct) – Provides detailed expectations for professional behaviour in the workplace.  
- [**Events Code of Conduct**](events-code-of-conduct) – Establishes acceptable behaviour for staff, participants, and partners at company events.  
- [**Standards of Conduct**](standards-of-conduct) – Summarises legal, professional, and organisational requirements for all employees.  
- [**Supplier Code of Conduct**](supplier-code-of-conduct) – Sets expectations for ethical, sustainable, and compliant behaviour among vendors and partners.

Each code is interconnected, collectively supporting our values of integrity, accountability, respect, and sustainability. Employees and partners are expected to be familiar with all relevant codes and ensure their actions align with these standards.

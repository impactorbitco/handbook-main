**Purpose**

Wholegrain is committed to the practice of responsible behaviour with our clients, suppliers, employees, contractors, workers, and any other agent working for us, or supplying services to us. Through our business practices, we seek to protect and promote the human rights and basic freedoms of these groups.

We are committed to protecting the rights of all of those whose work contributes to the success of Wholegrain, including those employees and agents of our suppliers.

We are committed to eliminating bribery and corruption in business. It is therefore essential that all our employees and persons associated with Wholegrain adhere to this policy and abstain from giving or receiving bribes of any form.

We will always act with integrity and professionalism in our work and strive to exceed our clients’ expectations and deliver high-quality work on time and within budget.

This policy is non-exhaustive, and all aspects of Wholegrain’s business and subsequent activities should be considered in the spirit of this policy.

Any, and all, personal data used in conjunction with this policy shall be collected, held, and processed in accordance with our ‘Data Protection Policy.’

This policy does not form part of your contract of employment and may be amended from time to time.

Human Rights

[Wholegrain is vehemently opposed to the use of slavery in all forms; cruel, inhuman, or degrading punishments; and any attempt to control or reduce freedom of thought, conscience, and religion.](https://unglobalcompact.org/what-is-gc/mission/principles/principle-3)

We will ensure that all of our officers, employees, contractors and workers are entitled to their human rights as set out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Human Rights Act 1998.

We will treat our colleagues and team members with respect and fairness.

[We will not enter into any business arrangement with any person, company or organisation which fails to uphold the human rights of its workers or who breach the human rights of those affected by the organisation’s activities.](https://unglobalcompact.org/what-is-gc/mission/principles/principle-8)

No employee should be discriminated against on the basis of their age, gender, disability, race, sexual orientation, religion or beliefs, gender reassignment, marital status, or pregnancy. All employees should be treated equally. Employees with the same experience and qualifications should receive equal pay for equal work.

No employee should be prevented from joining or forming a joint consultative committee or trade union. Nor should any employee suffer any detriment as a result of joining, or failing to join, any such organisation.

As an absolute minimum, we will ensure that we meet all applicable environmental laws in whichever jurisdiction we may be operating within.

# **Anti-Corruption**

[Principle 10](https://unglobalcompact.org/what-is-gc/mission/principles/principle-10): Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery

**Conflicts of Interest**

We will provide honest and accurate advice to our clients, even if it may not align with our own interests.

We will avoid conflicts of interest and disclose any potential conflicts to our clients and team members. Wholegrain holds as fundamental to its success the trust and confidence of those with whom it deals, including clients, suppliers, employees, contractors, and workers. Conflicts of interest potentially undermine the relationship of the company with such partners.

In order to help preserve and strengthen these relationships, we have developed a ‘Gifts and Entertainment Policy’ which provides the rules and guidelines concerning the conduct of Wholegrain’s officers, employees, contractors, and workers aimed at minimising the possibility of conflicts of interest and at avoiding risks associated with bribery and corruption.

All officers, employees, contractors, and workers of Wholegrain are expected to act honestly and within the law.

**Information and Confidentiality**

Information received by officers, employees, contractors, or workers of the company will not be used for any personal gain, nor will it be used for any purpose beyond that for which it was given. We will respect the confidentiality of our clients’ information and ideas.

We will never plagiarise or use other people’s work without proper attribution.

We will always be open to feedback and willing to improve our skills and processes.

We will process any personal data collected in accordance with our ‘Data Protection Policy’.

**Shareholders and Investors**

Wholegrain’s officers, employees, contractors, and workers are committed to ensuring that no act or omission which is within their power and which would have the effect of deliberately, negligently, or recklessly misleading the shareholders, creditors or other investors in the company occurs.

**Suppliers and Partners**

We expect our contractors, suppliers, and partners to work towards and uphold similar ethical and moral standards to our own.

We will investigate the ethical record of potential new contractors, suppliers, and partners before entering into any agreement with them. Furthermore, we may request information from them regarding the production and sources of goods supplied to us by them.

Wholegrain Digital will withdraw from any agreement or other arrangement with any contractor, supplier or partner who is found to have acted in contravention of the spirit or principles of this policy.

**Bribery and Corruption**

We will always strive to uphold the reputation of our agency and the web design industry as a whole.

We are fundamentally opposed to any acts of bribery and to the making of facilitation payments as defined by the Bribery Act 2010. Officers and employees, as well as any other persons associated with Wholegrain such as contractors, workers, agents, and business partners are not permitted to either offer or receive any type of bribe and/or facilitation payment.

All employees are encouraged to report any suspicion of corruption or bribery within Wholegrain in accordance with the ‘Whistleblower Policy aka Confidential Reporting Policy’.

Should any officer, employee, contractor or associated person be in any doubt when receiving or issuing gifts and hospitality, they must refer to the ‘Gifts and Entertainment Policy’.

If an officer, employee, contractor or associated person is found guilty of giving or receiving a bribe, they will be personally criminally liable and will be subject to disciplinary action. Anyone found guilty of bribery, will be responsible for bearing any related remedial costs such as losses, court fees or expenses.

Dear Colleague, Operating with Unwavering Integrity is the United Nations Development Programme’s (UNDP’s) first formal code of ethics. It is a guide to help us each resolve ethical issues in an increasingly complex global environment, and also serves as a proclamation of our commitment to the highest standards of integrity. While development efforts and business practices may change over time, our dedication to honesty, integrity, transparency, accountability and mutual respect remain constant. We believe that conducting our operations ethically is critical to our success, and this Code is a public statement confirming that integrity underlies everything we do at UNDP. We can all be proud of our pledge. Of course, no Code of Ethics can anticipate and address every situation. In many cases, common sense and good judgment will be your best guide. If you are unsure about any aspect of this Code or how it may apply to a situation with which you are faced, you are encouraged to consult with your supervisor. You may also send questions or concerns by email to ethicsoffice@undp.org or call UNDP’s ethics helpline +1-212-909-7840 or by logging in to the Ethics Intranet site. Whatever you do, keep in mind that when you act on the UNDP’s behalf, our reputation for honesty and integrity is in your hands. _____________________________ Achim Steiner, UNDP Administrator |       ___________________________________ Peter Liria, Director, UNDP Ethics Office

UNDERLYING DOCUMENTS This Code of Ethics is substantially based on UNDP’s values, together with the following key documents, which you are expected to read and embrace:

1. The Charter of the United Nations, which states that the paramount consideration in the employment of UN staff “shall be the necessity of securing the highest standards of efficiency, competence, and integrity.”

2. The Declaration, signed by all staff, declaring that they will act with independence and impartiality and regulate their conduct with the interests of the United Nations only in view, and not seek or accept instructions in regard to the performance of their duties from any Government or other external body.

3. The Staff Regulations, promulgated by the General Assembly, and supplemented by the Staff Rules issued by the Secretary General.  Together, the UN Staff Regulations and Staff Rules describe the fundamental conditions of service and the basic rights, duties and obligations of all UNDP staff.

4. The Standards of Conduct

for the International Civil Service, adopted by the General Assembly, for application to all staff of all United Nations system organizations. The Standards of Conduct provide that international civil servants have a special calling to serve our universal ideals of peace, respect for fundamental rights, and international cooperation.

5. The UNDP Legal Framework

for Addressing Non-Compliance with UN Standards of Conduct, which serves to remind staff of their duty to abide by the highest standards of conduct. It also defines the mechanisms that currently exist within UNDP for reporting allegations of wrongdoing, as well as what constitutes misconduct; it clarifies the responsibilities of each individual involved in the investigation of allegations of wrongdoing; it explains the procedure following investigation; and it outlines the disciplinary procedure

6. The UNDP Corporate Accountability Framework

which establishes the organization-wide accountability to programme countries, including project beneficiaries, and donors and is considered an “organizational accountability system to support increased transparency, clarity and alignment of all organizational activities.” The Corporate Accountability Framework has been developed to support the implementation of clear roles, accountabilities and decision making throughout the organization.

7. The Regulations Governing the Status, Basic Rights and Duties of Officials other than Secretariat Officials and Experts on Mission, which apply to non-staff service and individual contractors, and  require a declaration similar to that of staff, to exercise in all “loyalty, discretion and conscience the functions entrusted to me by the United Nations, to discharge these functions and regulate my conduct with the interests of the United Nations only in view.”

8. Conditions of Service

contain a similar obligation on the part of UN Volunteers to “undertake their duties in the interests of the United Nations. International UN Volunteers will uphold and promote the highest standards of ethical and professional conduct.”

Employment Contract

Service contract etc.

9. The UNDP POPP (Programme and Operations Policies and Procedures) which contains all of UNDP’s policy documents, relevant regulations and rules, as well as many templates, forms and business processes.

operational standards and procedural guidance on UNDP’s core business processes.

Policy areas

- Programme and Project Management
- Crisis Response
- Financial Resources Management
- Human Resources Management
- Procurement
- Partnerships
- Administrative Services
- Accountability
- Information and Communications Technology
- Security

10. UNDP Financial Regulations and Rules which describes the financial regulations and rules applicable to all UNDP operations, at Headquarters, at the Country Offices and at other UNDP offices worldwide. Rule 102.2 states “All personnel of UNDP are responsible to the Administrator for the regularity of actions taken by them in the course of their official duties. Any personnel who take any action contrary to these Financial Rules or to the instructions which may be issued in connection therewith may be held personally responsible and financially liable for the consequences of such action.”

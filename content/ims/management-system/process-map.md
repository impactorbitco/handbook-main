## 1. Purpose

The IMS Process Map provides a high-level overview of how the organisation’s activities are structured and managed within the Integrated Management System (IMS). It illustrates how processes interact to deliver value to customers and stakeholders while meeting quality, environmental, information security, and other applicable requirements.

The process map supports a process-based approach to management, ensuring clarity, consistency, and alignment between strategic objectives and operational delivery.

## 2. Process-Based Approach

The organisation adopts a process-based approach to managing its activities, whereby:
	•	Activities are understood and managed as interrelated processes
	•	Inputs, outputs, responsibilities, and controls are clearly defined
	•	Risks and opportunities are considered at each stage
	•	Performance is monitored and improved on a continual basis

This approach supports effective planning, control, and improvement across the IMS.

⸻

## 3. Overview of the IMS Process Map

The IMS Process Map is structured into three primary layers:
	1.	Leadership and Governance Processes
	2.	Core Operational Processes
	3.	Support and Enabling Processes

These process groups interact to ensure strategic direction is translated into effective and compliant operational outcomes.

⸻

## 4. Leadership and Governance Processes

Leadership and governance processes set direction and provide oversight for the IMS. These typically include:
	•	Strategic planning and objective setting
	•	Leadership, policy, and governance management
	•	Risk and opportunity management
	•	Compliance and legal requirements management
	•	Management review and decision-making

These processes ensure the IMS remains aligned with organisational strategy, stakeholder expectations, and applicable requirements.

⸻

## 5. Core Operational Processes

Core operational processes are those that directly deliver products and services to customers and stakeholders. These typically include:
	•	Business development and customer engagement
	•	Project planning and delivery
	•	Design, development, and service provision
	•	Monitoring, measurement, and performance delivery
	•	Customer communication and relationship management

These processes are controlled through defined procedures, roles, and performance measures to ensure consistent and high-quality outcomes.

⸻

## 6. Support and Enabling Processes

Support processes enable the effective operation of leadership and core processes. These typically include:
	•	People management, competence, and training
	•	Information security and data management
	•	Environmental and sustainability management
	•	Supplier and partner management
	•	IT systems, infrastructure, and tools
	•	Document and records control

Support processes ensure that resources, controls, and capabilities are in place to meet IMS requirements.

⸻

## 7. Process Interaction and Flow

Processes within the IMS are interconnected and managed as a coherent system:
	•	Leadership processes define objectives and controls
	•	Core processes transform inputs into value-adding outputs
	•	Support processes provide resources, systems, and assurance
	•	Feedback from monitoring, audits, incidents, and customer input informs improvement

This interaction ensures continual alignment between strategy, execution, and improvement.

⸻

## 8. Risks, Controls, and Performance

For each process, the organisation:
	•	Identifies risks and opportunities that could affect intended outcomes
	•	Applies proportionate controls to mitigate risks and enhance opportunities
	•	Defines responsibilities and authorities
	•	Monitors performance using appropriate indicators

Where performance does not meet expectations, corrective actions are implemented in line with the IMS improvement process.

⸻

## 9. Use and Maintenance of the Process Map

The IMS Process Map:
	•	Is maintained as a living reference for how the organisation operates
	•	Supports onboarding, training, and awareness activities
	•	Provides a framework for audits and management reviews
	•	Is reviewed periodically and updated to reflect organisational or regulatory changes

Any changes to the process map are approved and communicated in accordance with IMS document control procedures.

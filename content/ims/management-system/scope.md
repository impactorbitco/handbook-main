## 1. Purpose

The purpose of this Integrated Management System (IMS) is to define how the organisation establishes, implements, maintains, and continually improves its management systems in a structured and coherent way. The IMS integrates applicable requirements relating to quality, environmental management, information security, and other relevant governance and compliance frameworks into a single, aligned system.

This approach ensures consistency across processes, reduces duplication, supports risk-based decision-making, and enables the organisation to deliver services responsibly, securely, and sustainably.

## 2. Organisational Context

The IMS applies to the organisation’s activities, services, and operations as determined by:
	•	The organisation’s strategic objectives and business model
	•	The needs and expectations of customers, partners, regulators, and other stakeholders
	•	Applicable legal, regulatory, contractual, and ethical obligations
	•	Internal and external risks and opportunities

The system is designed to be proportionate to the size, nature, and complexity of the organisation and to evolve as the organisation grows or changes.

⸻

## 3. Scope of Application

The IMS covers:
	•	All core business activities, projects, and support functions
	•	Personnel, including employees, contractors, and relevant third parties
	•	Information assets, systems, and data processed by the organisation
	•	Physical, digital, and remote working environments

Where activities are outsourced or delivered in partnership, relevant IMS requirements are applied through supplier management, contractual controls, and oversight mechanisms.

Any exclusions from the IMS scope are documented, justified, and reviewed to ensure they do not affect the organisation’s ability to meet applicable requirements or deliver intended outcomes.

⸻

## 4. Standards and Frameworks

The IMS is aligned with, and may incorporate requirements from, the following standards and frameworks where applicable:
	•	ISO 9001 – Quality Management Systems
	•	ISO 14001 – Environmental Management Systems
	•	ISO/IEC 27001 – Information Security Management Systems
	•	ISO 45001 – Occupational Health and Safety Management Systems
	•	Relevant sector-specific, regulatory, or best-practice frameworks

The organisation may adopt additional standards over time, which will be integrated into the IMS to maintain a single, cohesive system.

⸻

## 5. Boundaries and Interfaces

The IMS defines clear boundaries between:
	•	Internal processes and external providers
	•	Strategic governance and operational delivery
	•	Organisational responsibilities and individual accountabilities

Interfaces with customers, suppliers, partners, and regulators are managed through documented processes to ensure alignment with IMS objectives and requirements.

⸻

## 6. Governance and Accountability

Senior management is accountable for:
	•	Establishing the scope of the IMS
	•	Ensuring the system remains appropriate to organisational objectives
	•	Providing resources and leadership support
	•	Reviewing performance and driving continual improvement

Roles, responsibilities, and authorities related to the IMS are defined and communicated across the organisation.

⸻

## 7. Review and Continual Improvement

The scope of the IMS is reviewed periodically, and at least annually, to ensure it remains:
	•	Relevant to the organisation’s activities and strategic direction
	•	Aligned with stakeholder expectations
	•	Compliant with applicable legal and regulatory requirements

Changes to the scope are documented, approved, and communicated as part of the organisation’s management review and continual improvement processes.

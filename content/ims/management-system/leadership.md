1. Purpose

Leadership is fundamental to the effectiveness of the Integrated Management System (IMS). This section defines how top management demonstrates leadership and commitment to the IMS, ensuring it is aligned with the organisation’s strategic direction, values, and long-term objectives.

Effective leadership ensures that quality, environmental responsibility, information security, health and safety, and other applicable management disciplines are embedded into day-to-day decision-making rather than treated as standalone compliance activities.

	•	Integrating IMS requirements into business processes and operational planning
	•	Promoting a culture of continual improvement, risk awareness, and responsible behaviour
	•	Ensuring that ethical, legal, regulatory, and contractual obligations are understood and met

Leadership commitment is demonstrated through visible actions, clear decision-making, and ongoing engagement rather than delegation alone.

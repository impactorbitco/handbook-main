# 3 Terms and definitions

Core Principals: The CIA Triad
The core principles that drive this ISO standard is based on what is known as the CIA Triad: Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability. These three concepts not only form the foundation of this rule but are also very important in protecting sensitive information from cyber risks.
Confidentiality
As the word suggests, confidentiality is all about ensuring that sensitive information is only accessible to those who are authorised. This could include customer data, business information or any intellectual property. Without proper confidentiality, businesses risk exposing their valuable information to cyberattacks, leaks or misuse. This is why ISO 27001 encourages organisations to implement strict access controls, encryption and monitoring systems to protect sensitive data.
Integrity
This component ensures that any information remains accurate and reliable over time. It’s not just about protecting data from unauthorised access but protecting it from being tampered with or altered. Just imagine the consequences if financial records, patient data or product details were changed without authorisation.
Availability
The last component confirms that information is accessible and usable when needed. If a system goes down or data is unavailable during a critical moment, the business can face major disruptions. For example, if a healthcare entity can’t access patient data due to a system failure, it could impact lives. This is why this rule stresses the importance of having strong backup systems along with a good infrastructure in place so companies can continue operations smoothly even when unexpected events happen.
**Users** – All individuals with access to Green Orbit Digital’s IT systems, including employees, contractors, suppliers, clients, and business partners.
**Systems** – IT equipment, software, internet services, video or voice communication tools connected to corporate networks or applications provided by Green Orbit Digital.
**Data** – Any electronic information.
**Data Store** – Any device, network drive, or cloud-based storage used for data storage.
**Password** – A sequence of characters or PIN numbers used for verification.

**Annex A Information security controls**

Overview Of Annex A Controls

Annex A is divided into four categories of controls, each addressing a specific aspect of information security: organisational, people, physical and technological. ISO 27001 provides significant flexibility, enabling businesses to implement controls based on their unique risks and requirements. However, any exclusions must be justified to ensure the ISMS remains robust and compliant.

One key policy within Annex A is the Clear Desk Policy. This policy requires employees to ensure that sensitive information is safe, including all paper documents and devices containing confidential data. It also ensures that no information is left unattended in an unsecured environment. This policy directly impacts all physical security, so it can’t be overstated. Implementing the Clear Desk Policy reduces the risk of unauthorised access to sensitive information, ensuring that data is protected even when employees are away from their desks.

[Statement of Applicability](https://www.notion.so/Statement-of-Applicability-1c0d6625c679811ca9a9e1b718fd2938?pvs=21) : What It Is & Why It Matters

The statement lists which controls from Annex A are being applied, the rationale for applying or excluding specific controls, and the status of their implementation. Making it a dynamic part of the ISMS, this document is reviewed periodically to ensure it remains up to date with changing threats and evolving security needs.

One of the key purposes of the SoA is to serve as evidence of compliance during audits. Auditors will examine the statement to verify that the organisation has appropriately selected controls based on its risk assessment and context. It also ensures that no controls are omitted without a valid reason. The SoA helps provide a structured, consistent approach to assessing and documenting the security measures in place.

Having a clear and well-maintained ISO 27001 Statement of Applicability not only ensures compliance with the standard but also reinforces the corporation’s commitment to data protection and security.

How to Create and Maintain an Effective SoA Document

First, a thorough risk assessment must be conducted. This will identify the security threats, vulnerabilities and risks. Based on these findings, the relevant controls from Annex A of this rule’s standard are selected.

Some controls may be deemed unnecessary for certain organisations, while others may require additional focus. For each control, the SoA should include a description of the control, its status (whether implemented or in progress), and an explanation of why it was selected. If a control is excluded, the document should justify why it is not relevant to the organisation’s risks or operational environment.

Additionally, the SoA should outline the ownership of each control. This helps ensure accountability and clarifies who within the company is responsible for managing and maintaining each security measure.

Regular updates are necessary as the organisation’s context and risk landscape evolve. As the business environment changes, new risks may emerge, and existing controls may need to be reviewed, refined or replaced. A review process should be established with periodic audits to check whether the controls are still aligned with goals and objectives. If any gaps are identified, corrective actions should be taken to address them.

Another important aspect to consider is the involvement of relevant stakeholders. The statement of applicability should not be a document created solely by the security team or compliance officers. This collaborative approach ensures that the SoA accurately reflects the corporation’s broader security strategy.

---

# **3 Terms and definitions**

Core Principals: The CIA Triad

The core principles that drive this ISO standard is based on what is known as the CIA Triad: Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability. These three concepts not only form the foundation of this rule but are also very important in protecting sensitive information from cyber risks.

Confidentiality

As the word suggests, confidentiality is all about ensuring that sensitive information is only accessible to those who are authorised. This could include customer data, business information or any intellectual property. Without proper confidentiality, businesses risk exposing their valuable information to cyberattacks, leaks or misuse. This is why ISO 27001 encourages organisations to implement strict access controls, encryption and monitoring systems to protect sensitive data.

Integrity

This component ensures that any information remains accurate and reliable over time. It’s not just about protecting data from unauthorised access but protecting it from being tampered with or altered. Just imagine the consequences if financial records, patient data or product details were changed without authorisation.

Availability

The last component confirms that information is accessible and usable when needed. If a system goes down or data is unavailable during a critical moment, the business can face major disruptions. For example, if a healthcare entity can’t access patient data due to a system failure, it could impact lives. This is why this rule stresses the importance of having strong backup systems along with a good infrastructure in place so companies can continue operations smoothly even when unexpected events happen.

**Users** – All individuals with access to Green Orbit Digital’s IT systems, including employees, contractors, suppliers, clients, and business partners.

**Systems** – IT equipment, software, internet services, video or voice communication tools connected to corporate networks or applications provided by Green Orbit Digital.

**Data** – Any electronic information.

**Data Store** – Any device, network drive, or cloud-based storage used for data storage.

**Password** – A sequence of characters or PIN numbers used for verification.

The Importance of Internal Audits

Internal audits identify weaknesses in security controls as these are effective in uncovering potential risks and detecting non-conformities before performing external audits. Doing this helps companies take proper actions before the external audit – to ensure a ‘pass’ is issued on the first go.

Internal audits provide valuable insights into how well employees understand and follow security policies. If gaps are found, businesses can take steps to improve training, update documentation and strengthen overall security practices.

Steps to Prepare for an Internal Audit

Preparing for an internal audit requires a structured approach. Below are the key steps corporations should follow:

Define the Audit Scope and Plan

Start by outlining what the audit will cover. This includes defining the processes, departments, and security controls that will be assessed. An effective audit requires a clear plan. This should include audit objectives, key areas of focus, timelines and assigned responsibilities.

Conduct Risk Assessments

Performing a risk assessment before the audit helps identify areas where security improvements may be needed. It also ensures that auditors focus on the most critical aspects of the ISMS.

Review Documentation

Review all relevant documentation including policies, risk assessments, the Statement of Applicability and security procedures.

Engage Employees

Employees should be informed about the audit process and what to expect. To help employees understand security policies, companies should provide proper training and refresher sessions.

Perform the Internal Audit

The audit should be conducted by qualified internal auditors who are independent of the areas being audited. They will assess compliance by reviewing documentation, interviewing employees and testing security controls.

| Common ISMS Issues: | Issue Description: | Recommended Solution: |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Incomplete or Outdated Documentation | Security policies, risk assessments, or SoA are outdated or missing key details. | Regularly review and update documentation to reflect current practices and risks. |
| Lack of Employee Awareness | Employees are unaware of security policies or fail to follow procedures. | Conduct ongoing security awareness training to ensure compliance and understanding. |
| Weak Access Controls | Inadequate controls allow unauthorised access to sensitive data. | Enforce strict access policies, apply MFA, and review access permissions regularly. |
| Failure to Conduct Risk Assessments | No regular risk assessments or outdated risk treatment plans. | Schedule periodic risk assessments and integrate risk management into operations. |
| Lack of Incident Response Procedures | No clear process for identifying and managing security incidents. | Develop formal incident response procedures and run regular drills to test effectiveness. |

# **10 Improvement**

Improvements should be driven by regular audits and evaluation outcomes, ensuring the management system remains adaptable to evolving risks. Organisations must take necessary actions as needed and maintain a continuous feedback loop for enhancement. This may include revising policies, updating employee training programs and adopting new technologies to address emerging threats.

**10.2 Nonconformity and corrective action**

Document Findings and Non-Conformities

All findings should be recorded in an audit report. If any non-conformities are identified, they should be documented along with recommendations for corrective actions.

Implement Corrective Actions

After the audit, corrective actions should be taken to address non-conformities. This may involve updating policies, improving security controls, or providing additional training to employees.

Common Non-Conformities and How to Address Them

During an internal audit of this rule, corporations often encounter common non-conformities. Addressing these issues proactively can prevent certification delays and improve overall security.

# **Annex A Information security controls**

Overview Of Annex A Controls

Annex A is divided into four categories of controls, each addressing a specific aspect of information security: organisational, people, physical and technological. ISO 27001 provides significant flexibility, enabling businesses to implement controls based on their unique risks and requirements. However, any exclusions must be justified to ensure the ISMS remains robust and compliant.

One key policy within Annex A is the Clear Desk Policy. This policy requires employees to ensure that sensitive information is safe, including all paper documents and devices containing confidential data. It also ensures that no information is left unattended in an unsecured environment. This policy directly impacts all physical security, so it can’t be overstated. Implementing the Clear Desk Policy reduces the risk of unauthorised access to sensitive information, ensuring that data is protected even when employees are away from their desks.

Statement of Applicability: What It Is & Why It Matters

The statement lists which controls from Annex A are being applied, the rationale for applying or excluding specific controls, and the status of their implementation. Making it a dynamic part of the ISMS, this document is reviewed periodically to ensure it remains up to date with changing threats and evolving security needs.

One of the key purposes of the SoA is to serve as evidence of compliance during audits. Auditors will examine the statement to verify that the organisation has appropriately selected controls based on its risk assessment and context. It also ensures that no controls are omitted without a valid reason. The SoA helps provide a structured, consistent approach to assessing and documenting the security measures in place.

Having a clear and well-maintained ISO 27001 Statement of Applicability not only ensures compliance with the standard but also reinforces the corporation’s commitment to data protection and security.

How to Create and Maintain an Effective SoA Document

First, a thorough risk assessment must be conducted. This will identify the security threats, vulnerabilities and risks. Based on these findings, the relevant controls from Annex A of this rule’s standard are selected.

Some controls may be deemed unnecessary for certain organisations, while others may require additional focus. For each control, the SoA should include a description of the control, its status (whether implemented or in progress), and an explanation of why it was selected. If a control is excluded, the document should justify why it is not relevant to the organisation’s risks or operational environment.

Additionally, the SoA should outline the ownership of each control. This helps ensure accountability and clarifies who within the company is responsible for managing and maintaining each security measure.

Regular updates are necessary as the organisation’s context and risk landscape evolve. As the business environment changes, new risks may emerge, and existing controls may need to be reviewed, refined or replaced. A review process should be established with periodic audits to check whether the controls are still aligned with goals and objectives. If any gaps are identified, corrective actions should be taken to address them.

Another important aspect to consider is the involvement of relevant stakeholders. The statement of applicability should not be a document created solely by the security team or compliance officers. This collaborative approach ensures that the SoA accurately reflects the corporation’s broader security strategy.

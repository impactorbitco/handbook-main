# **Introduction**

**0.1 General**

Green Orbit Digital’s success depends on the effective implementation and continuous improvement of a management system designed to enhance performance while meeting the needs of stakeholders. The Management System for Records (MSR) provides a structured approach to decision-making and resource management, ensuring the achievement of organisational goals.

As a company focused on sustainable marketing, space-driven solutions, and digital transformation, Green Orbit Digital recognises that the creation and management of records are integral to its activities, processes, and systems. Effective records management enables business efficiency, accountability, risk mitigation, and continuity. It also enhances the organisation’s ability to harness information as a strategic asset, contributing to the transparency and sustainability of its operations in a complex global and digital environment.

**0.2 Management System**

Management system standards (MSS) offer methodologies for systematic and verifiable organisational control. These standards support good business practices and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements.

The MSR framework provides Green Orbit Digital with a foundation for implementing, operating, and improving a robust records management system. This framework enables the organisation to establish policies and objectives for records management while ensuring adherence to:

- Clearly defined roles and responsibilities
- Systematic processes
- Performance measurement and evaluation
- Continuous review and improvement

By implementing a comprehensive records policy aligned with business needs, Green Orbit Digital ensures the creation, management, and accessibility of authoritative and reliable records. A well-executed MSR enhances transparency, traceability, and decision-making accountability, reinforcing public trust and regulatory compliance.

**0.3 Relationship with Other Records Standards**

Green Orbit Digital aligns its MSR with internationally recognised standards, including ISO 15489-1, which provides best practices for records management. These standards guide the organisation in designing, implementing, monitoring, and improving its records processes and controls. The MSR operates within the broader MSS framework, ensuring compatibility with other management system standards.

ISO 15489-1 serves as the foundational standard for Green Orbit Digital’s approach to records management, ensuring structured governance and regulatory adherence. The organisation also monitors updates to international standards to integrate best practices into its MSR framework.

**0.4 MSR Family of Standards**

The MSR standards support the needs of:

- **Top management**: Responsible for making strategic decisions on MSR implementation and compliance.
- **Records management professionals**: Ensuring proper execution of MSR policies and procedures.
- **Risk management, auditing, and IT teams**: Overseeing compliance, security, and technological integration.

The process-based approach adopted by Green Orbit Digital emphasises:

- Identifying records management requirements based on stakeholder needs and expectations.
- Implementing risk management measures to safeguard records in alignment with business objectives.
- Monitoring, reviewing, and improving the MSR’s effectiveness through performance assessments.
- Driving continual improvement based on objective measurements and industry best practices.

**0.5 Relationship and Compatibility with Other Management System Standards**

Green Orbit Digital’s MSR aligns with ISO’s high-level structure for management system standards, ensuring consistency and integration across multiple compliance frameworks. The organisation recognises the importance of documented information within management systems, as outlined in Section 7.5 of all MSS.

By embedding records management within its broader operational and sustainability strategies, Green Orbit Digital not only ensures compliance but also leverages records as a tool for driving innovation, transparency, and long-term business success.

**10.1 Nonconformity and Corrective Actions**

To maintain the integrity of the MSR, Green Orbit Digital must identify, assess, and rectify any nonconformities in records management. The organisation follows a structured approach:

- **Detection and Reporting**: Employees are encouraged to report discrepancies, errors, or inefficiencies in records management through established reporting mechanisms.
- **Investigation and Root Cause Analysis**: Each reported nonconformity undergoes thorough analysis to determine the root cause, ensuring corrective actions address underlying issues.
- **Corrective Actions**: Implementing targeted solutions such as process modifications, additional training, or technological enhancements to prevent recurrence.
- **Documentation and Tracking**: Maintaining records of all identified nonconformities, actions taken, and effectiveness assessments to ensure transparency and accountability.
- **Review and Verification**: Evaluating corrective measures' impact through follow-up audits and continuous monitoring to confirm sustained compliance and improvement.

**10.2 Continual Improvement**

Green Orbit Digital fosters a proactive approach to continual improvement, ensuring that records management processes evolve alongside industry best practices and technological advancements. The organisation achieves this by:

- **Regular Performance Reviews**: Analysing key metrics and stakeholder feedback to identify improvement opportunities.
- **Technology Integration**: Leveraging AI, automation, and space-driven solutions to optimise records management efficiency and security.
- **Training and Development**: Providing ongoing education on emerging compliance standards, data protection laws, and sustainable records management practices.
- **Benchmarking and Best Practices**: Collaborating with industry leaders and regulatory bodies to stay ahead of trends and implement leading-edge solutions.
- **Innovation and Adaptation**: Encouraging a culture of innovation where employees contribute ideas for enhancing records management strategies.
- **Sustainability Alignment**: Ensuring that improvements align with Green Orbit Digital’s sustainability objectives, enhancing environmental responsibility in digital record-keeping.

By embedding a continuous improvement mindset into its MSR, Green Orbit Digital ensures long-term resilience, operational efficiency, and compliance with evolving global standards.

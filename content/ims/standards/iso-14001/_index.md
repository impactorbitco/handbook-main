# 0. Introduction

This EMS outlines the processes and responsibilities for managing environmental aspects within Green Orbit Digital. It ensures compliance with applicable legal requirements and promotes sustainability in operations, consistent with ISO 14001.

### 0.1 Background

Balancing environmental, social, and economic factors is essential to meet present needs while safeguarding future generations' ability to meet their own needs. This sustainable development goal is achieved by carefully managing these three pillars of sustainability.

Societal expectations for sustainable development, transparency and accountability have evolved with increasingly stringent legislation, growing pressures on the environment from pollution, inefficient use of resources, improper waste management, climate change, degradation of ecosystems and loss of biodiversity.

This has led organisations to adopt a systematic approach to environmental management by implementing environmental management systems with the aim of contributing to the environmental pillar of sustainability.

### 0.2 Aim of an environmental management system

The purpose of this International Standard is to provide organisations with a framework to protect the environment and respond to changing environmental conditions in balance with socio-economic needs. It specifies requirements that enable an organisation to achieve the intended outcomes it sets for its environmental management system.

A systematic approach to environmental management can provide top management with information to build success over the long term and create options for contributing to sustainable development by:

- protecting the environment by preventing or mitigating adverse environmental impacts;
- mitigating the potential adverse effect of environmental conditions on the organisation;
- assisting the organisation in the fulfilment of compliance obligations; enhancing environmental performance;
- controlling or influencing the way the organisation's products and services are designed, manufactured, distributed, consumed and disposed by using a life cycle perspective that can prevent environmental impacts from being unintentionally shifted elsewhere within the life cycle;
- achieving financial and operational benefits that can result from implementing environmentally sound alternatives that strengthen the organisation’s market position;
- communicating environmental information to relevant interested parties.

This International Standard, like other International Standards, is not intended to increase or change an organisation’s legal requirements.

### 0.3 Success factors

The success of an environmental management system depends on commitment from all levels and functions of the organisation, led by top management. organisations can leverage opportunities to prevent or mitigate adverse environmental impacts and enhance beneficial environmental impacts, particularly those with strategic and competitive implications. Top management can effectively address its risks and opportunities by integrating environmental management into the organisation's business processes, strategic direction and decision making, aligning them with other business priorities, and incorporating environmental governance into its overall management system. 

Demonstration of successful implementation of this International Standard can be used to assure interested parties that an effective environmental management system is in place.Adoption of this International Standard, however, will not in itself guarantee optimal environmental outcomes. Application of this International Standard can differ from one organisation to another due to the context of the organisation. Two organisations can carry out similar activities but can have different compliance obligations, commitments in their environmental policy, environmental technologies and environmental performance goals, yet both can conform to the requirements of this International Standard.

The level of detail and complexity of the environmental management system will vary depending on the context of the organisation, the scope of its environmental management system, its compliance obligations, and the nature of its activities, products and services, including its environmental aspects and associated environmental impacts.

### 0.4 Plan-Do-Check-Act model

The basis for the approach underlying an environmental management system is founded on the concept of Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA). The PDCA model provides an iterative process used by organisations to achieve continual improvement. It can be applied to an environmental management system and to each of its individual elements. It can be briefly described as follows.

- Plan: establish environmental objectives and processes necessary to deliver results in accordance with the organisation’s environmental policy.
- Do: implement the processes as planned.
- Check: monitor and measure processes against the environmental policy, including its commitments, environmental objectives and operating criteria, and report the results.
- Act: take actions to continually improve.

Figure 1 shows how the framework introduced in this International Standard could be integrated into a PDCA model, which can help new and existing users to understand the importance of a systems approach.

Figure 1 Relationship between PDCA and the framework in this International Standard

### 0.5 Contents of this International Standard

This International Standard conforms to ISO’s requirements for management system standards. These requirements include a high level structure, identical core text, and common terms with core definitions, designed to benefit users implementing multiple ISO management system standards.

This International Standard does not include requirements specific to other management systems, such as those for quality, occupational health and safety, energy or financial management. However, this International Standard enables an organisation to use a common approach and risk-based thinking to integrate its environmental management system with the requirements of other management systems.

This International Standard contains the requirements used to assess conformity. An organisation that wishes to demonstrate conformity with this International Standard can do so by:

- making a self-determination and self-declaration, or seeking confirmation of its conformance by parties having an interest in the organisation, such as customers, or seeking confirmation of its self-declaration by a party external to the organisation, or seeking certification/registration of its environmental management system by an external organisation.

Annex A provides explanatory information to prevent misinterpretation of the requirements of this International Standard. 

Annex B shows broad technical correspondence between the previous edition of this International Standard and this edition. 

Implementation guidance on environmental management systems is included in ISO 14004. In this International Standard, the following verbal forms are used:

- “shall” indicates a requirement;
- “should” indicates a recommendation;
- “may” indicates a permission;
- “can” indicates a possibility or a capability.

*Information marked as “NOTE” is intended to assist the understanding or use of the document. “Notes to entry” used in Clause 3 provide additional information that supplements the terminological data and can contain provisions relating to the use of a term.The terms and definitions in Clause 3 are arranged in conceptual order, with an alphabetical index provided at the end of the document.*

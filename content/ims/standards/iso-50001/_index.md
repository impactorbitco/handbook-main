## Introduction

Green Orbit Digital is committed to enhancing its energy performance, encompassing energy efficiency, usage, and consumption. By adopting the ISO 50001:2018 standard, we aim to establish robust systems and processes that lead to measurable improvements in energy performance, thereby reducing greenhouse gas emissions, minimizing environmental impacts, and lowering energy costs through systematic energy management.

This standard is applicable to organisations of all types and sizes, regardless of geographical, cultural, or social conditions. Its successful implementation relies on the commitment of all organisational levels and functions, particularly top management.

ISO 50001:2018 outlines the requirements for an energy management system (EnMS), enabling organisations to develop and implement an energy policy, set objectives and targets, and formulate action plans that consider legal requirements and information related to significant energy uses. An effective EnMS allows organisations to fulfill their policy commitments, take necessary actions to improve energy performance, and demonstrate conformity to the standard's requirements.

The standard applies to activities under the organisation's control and can be tailored to fit specific requirements, including system complexity, documentation level, and resource availability.

ISO 50001:2018 is based on the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) continual improvement framework, integrating energy management into everyday organisational practices:

- **Plan**: Conduct an energy review and establish the baseline, energy performance indicators (EnPIs), objectives, targets, and action plans necessary to deliver results that will improve energy performance in accordance with the organisation's energy policy.
- **Do**: Implement the energy management action plans.
- **Check**: Monitor and measure processes and the key characteristics of operations that determine energy performance against the energy policy and objectives, and report the results.
- **Act**: Take actions to continually improve energy performance and the EnMS.

By implementing ISO 50001:2018, Green Orbit Digital aims to contribute to the efficient use of energy resources, enhance competitiveness, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental impacts. The standard is applicable regardless of the types of energy used and can be used for certification, registration, or self-declaration of an organisation's EnMS.

ISO 50001:2018 is compatible with other ISO management system standards, notably ISO 9001 and ISO 14001, facilitating integration with existing management systems related to quality, environment, and occupational health and safety.

# 1 Scope

ISO 50001:2018 specifies requirements for establishing, implementing, maintaining, and improving an energy management system, enabling organisations to follow a systematic approach in achieving continual improvement of energy performance, including energy efficiency, energy use, and consumption.

The standard's requirements apply to energy use and consumption, including measurement, documentation, and reporting, as well as design and procurement practices for equipment, systems, processes, and personnel that contribute to energy performance.

ISO 50001:2018 applies to all variables affecting energy performance that can be monitored and influenced by the organisation. It does not prescribe specific performance criteria concerning energy.

Designed for independent use, ISO 50001:2018 can also be aligned or integrated with other management systems. It is applicable to any organisation wishing to ensure conformity to its stated energy policy and demonstrate this to others, with conformity confirmed through self-evaluation, self-declaration, or certification by an external organisation.

Annex A of the standard provides informative guidance on its use.

1. Purpose

This procedure defines how new personnel are onboarded into the Integrated Management System (IMS) to ensure they understand their roles, responsibilities, and obligations in relation to quality, environmental management, information security, health and safety, and other applicable IMS requirements.

Effective onboarding ensures consistent application of IMS controls, promotes awareness of risks and responsibilities, and supports a culture of compliance and continual improvement from the outset.

2. Scope

This procedure applies to:
	•	All new employees
	•	Contractors, consultants, and temporary personnel
	•	Relevant third parties where access to systems, information, or facilities is provided

The level and depth of onboarding is proportionate to the individual’s role, responsibilities, and level of risk exposure.

3. Principles of IMS Onboarding

The organisation’s onboarding approach is based on the following principles:
	•	Early introduction to IMS expectations and culture
	•	Role-based relevance and proportionality
	•	Clear accountability and ownership
	•	Ongoing awareness rather than one-off training
	•	Integration with wider people and capability processes

4. Roles and Responsibilities
	•	Top Management is responsible for setting expectations and demonstrating commitment to the IMS.
	•	IMS Lead is responsible for defining onboarding content and ensuring IMS requirements are communicated.
	•	Line Managers / Supervisors are responsible for ensuring individuals understand and apply IMS requirements relevant to their role.
	•	Individuals are responsible for complying with IMS policies and procedures and raising concerns or incidents.

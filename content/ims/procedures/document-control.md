1. Purpose

This procedure defines how documented information within the Integrated Management System (IMS) is created, reviewed, approved, maintained, protected, and controlled. Its purpose is to ensure that documents and records are accurate, up to date, accessible to those who need them, and protected against loss, misuse, or unauthorised change.

Effective document control supports consistency, compliance, traceability, and continual improvement across the IMS.

⸻

2. Scope

This procedure applies to all documented information required by the IMS, including:
	•	Policies, procedures, and process documentation
	•	Plans, manuals, and guidance documents
	•	Records demonstrating conformity and performance
	•	Documents of internal or external origin relevant to the IMS
	•	Digital and physical documented information

This includes documents maintained internally as well as those stored on approved external platforms or systems.

⸻

3. Definitions
	•	Documented Information: Information required to be controlled and maintained by the IMS, including documents and records.
	•	Document: Information maintained and updated to support operations (e.g. policies, procedures).
	•	Record: Information retained as evidence of activities performed or results achieved.

⸻

4. Principles of Document Control

The organisation ensures that documented information:
	•	Is suitable and adequate for its intended purpose
	•	Is available where and when it is needed
	•	Is protected from unintended alteration or loss
	•	Reflects current practices and requirements
	•	Supports transparency, accountability, and auditability

⸻

5. Creation and Identification

All IMS documents are:
	•	Created using approved templates where applicable
	•	Clearly identified with a title, version number, and date
	•	Assigned an owner responsible for content accuracy and maintenance
	•	Classified according to relevance, sensitivity, and access requirements

The level of documentation is proportionate to the complexity and risk of the activity.

⸻

6. Review and Approval

Documents are reviewed and approved prior to issue to ensure they are:
	•	Accurate and complete
	•	Consistent with IMS policies and objectives
	•	Compliant with applicable requirements

Approval authority is defined based on the document type. Documents are reviewed periodically, and at least annually, or when changes occur that could affect their validity.

⸻

7. Version Control and Change Management

The organisation ensures that:
	•	Only the current approved version of a document is available for use
	•	Changes are reviewed, approved, and communicated before implementation
	•	Previous versions are removed from points of use or clearly identified as obsolete
	•	A record of significant changes is maintained where appropriate

Uncontrolled or informal documents are not used for IMS-critical activities.

⸻

8. Access, Distribution, and Use

Documented information is:
	•	Stored in approved systems or repositories
	•	Accessible to authorised personnel as required for their role
	•	Protected through access controls, permissions, or security measures

External documents (e.g. standards, regulations, client documentation) are identified and controlled to ensure relevant versions are available and used.

⸻

9. Control of Records

IMS records are controlled to ensure they:
	•	Provide evidence of conformity and effective operation
	•	Are legible, identifiable, and traceable
	•	Are stored securely to prevent loss, damage, or unauthorised access
	•	Are retained for defined periods based on legal, regulatory, and business requirements

Retention and disposal of records are managed in accordance with organisational and legal obligations.

⸻

10. Protection and Confidentiality

Documented information is protected to ensure:
	•	Confidentiality, integrity, and availability
	•	Compliance with information security and data protection requirements
	•	Appropriate handling of sensitive or restricted information

Controls may include access restrictions, backups, encryption, and secure disposal methods.

⸻

11. Review and Continual Improvement

The effectiveness of document control is reviewed through:
	•	Internal audits
	•	Management reviews
	•	Feedback from users of documented information
	•	Incident or nonconformity analysis

Improvements to document control processes are implemented as part of the IMS continual improvement framework.

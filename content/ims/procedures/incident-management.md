1. Purpose

This procedure defines how the organisation identifies, reports, manages, investigates, and learns from incidents within the Integrated Management System (IMS). The purpose is to minimise harm, reduce the likelihood of recurrence, and ensure continual improvement across quality, environmental management, information security, health and safety, and other applicable IMS areas.

Effective incident management supports transparency, accountability, compliance, and organisational learning.

⸻

2. Scope

This procedure applies to:
	•	All incidents, near misses, and adverse events related to IMS activities
	•	All personnel, including employees, contractors, and relevant third parties
	•	All operational, digital, physical, and remote working environments
	•	Incidents arising from internal activities or external parties under the organisation’s control

⸻

3. Definitions
	•	Incident: An unplanned event that has resulted in, or could have resulted in, harm, loss, disruption, nonconformity, or breach of requirements.
	•	Near Miss: An event that did not result in harm or loss but had the potential to do so.
	•	Nonconformity: Failure to meet a requirement of the IMS, applicable standards, or legal obligations.
	•	Corrective Action: Action taken to eliminate the cause of an incident or nonconformity to prevent recurrence.

⸻

4. Principles of Incident Management

The organisation manages incidents in accordance with the following principles:
	•	Prompt reporting and response
	•	Proportionate investigation based on risk and impact
	•	Focus on root causes rather than blame
	•	Transparency and clear communication
	•	Learning and continual improvement

⸻

5. Incident Identification and Reporting

All personnel are responsible for identifying and reporting incidents and near misses as soon as practicable.

Incidents may include, but are not limited to:
	•	Quality failures or service disruptions
	•	Information security or data protection incidents
	•	Environmental incidents or spills
	•	Health and safety incidents or hazards
	•	Legal, regulatory, or contractual breaches

Incidents are reported using approved reporting channels and recorded in the incident log or management system.

⸻

6. Initial Response and Containment

Upon identification of an incident, appropriate actions are taken to:
	•	Ensure the safety and wellbeing of people
	•	Contain or limit further impact or damage
	•	Secure affected systems, information, or environments
	•	Preserve evidence where investigation is required

Escalation to management or specialist support occurs where the incident exceeds defined thresholds or poses significant risk.

⸻

7. Classification and Assessment

Reported incidents are:
	•	Classified by type, severity, and potential impact
	•	Assessed to determine actual and potential consequences
	•	Evaluated against legal, regulatory, contractual, and IMS requirements

The level of investigation and response is proportionate to the risk and severity of the incident.

⸻

8. Investigation and Root Cause Analysis

Where required, incidents are investigated to:
	•	Understand what happened and why
	•	Identify immediate, underlying, and systemic causes
	•	Determine whether IMS controls were adequate and effective

Appropriate investigation techniques may be used depending on complexity and impact.

⸻

9. Corrective and Preventive Actions

Following investigation, corrective actions are defined and implemented to:
	•	Eliminate root causes of the incident or nonconformity
	•	Prevent recurrence of similar incidents
	•	Address identified weaknesses in processes, controls, or training

Actions are assigned owners, target dates, and monitored for effectiveness.

⸻

10. Communication and Reporting

Incidents are communicated appropriately to:
	•	Affected personnel and stakeholders
	•	Senior management
	•	Customers, partners, or regulators where required

Communication is timely, accurate, and proportionate to the incident’s impact and obligations.

⸻

11. Records and Documentation

Records related to incident management include:
	•	Incident reports and logs
	•	Investigation findings and evidence
	•	Corrective action plans and outcomes
	•	Communications and notifications

All records are controlled in accordance with IMS document and records control procedures.

⸻

12. Review and Continual Improvement

Incident data is reviewed to:
	•	Identify trends and recurring issues
	•	Evaluate effectiveness of controls and responses
	•	Inform risk assessments and process improvements
	•	Support management review and decision-making

Lessons learned are shared where appropriate to strengthen organisational awareness and resilience.

## 1. Purpose

This procedure defines how the organisation plans, implements, and controls its processes and activities within the Integrated Management System (IMS). The objective is to ensure that all operations are carried out in a controlled, consistent, and effective manner that meets organisational objectives, stakeholder expectations, and applicable quality, environmental, information security, and other management system requirements.

⸻

## 2. Scope

This procedure applies to:
- All processes defined within the IMS process map
- All personnel, including employees, contractors, and relevant third parties
- Activities undertaken at all organisational locations, including remote and digital environments
- Outsourced processes and externally provided products or services where applicable

⸻

## 3. Principles of Control

The organisation applies the following principles when controlling IMS processes:
- Processes are planned before implementation
- Responsibilities and authorities are clearly defined
- Risks and opportunities are identified and addressed
- Controls are proportionate to the nature and impact of the activity
- Performance is monitored and reviewed
- Continual improvement is embedded into operations

⸻

## 4. Process Planning and Definition

Each IMS process is:
- Clearly defined with documented inputs, activities, and outputs
- Assigned to a process owner responsible for effectiveness and compliance
- Aligned with organisational objectives and relevant policies
- Supported by procedures, work instructions, or guidance as appropriate

Changes to processes are planned, assessed for risk, and approved prior to implementation.

⸻

## 5. Risk-Based Controls

The organisation applies a risk-based approach to process control by:
- Identifying risks and opportunities associated with each process
- Assessing potential impacts on quality, compliance, security, environment, and stakeholders
- Implementing controls to mitigate risks and enhance opportunities
- Reviewing controls to ensure they remain effective

Risk controls may include procedural steps, approvals, segregation of duties, technical safeguards, or monitoring activities.

⸻

## 6. Operational Controls

Operational controls are implemented to ensure processes are carried out as planned and may include:
- Defined procedures and documented workflows
- Approval and authorisation requirements
- Use of standard tools, templates, and systems
- Access controls and information security measures
- Environmental and sustainability controls
- Supplier and partner oversight

Controls are applied consistently and reviewed regularly for suitability and effectiveness.

⸻

## 7. Control of Outsourced Processes

Where processes or activities are outsourced, the organisation ensures control through:
- Defined requirements and expectations
- Supplier evaluation and selection criteria
- Contractual and service-level controls
- Ongoing monitoring of performance and compliance

Outsourced processes remain the responsibility of the organisation within the scope of the IMS.

⸻

## 8. Monitoring and Measurement

The organisation monitors controlled processes by:
- Defining performance indicators and acceptance criteria
- Conducting regular reviews and status checks
- Using audits, inspections, or management reviews as appropriate
- Recording outcomes and evidence of conformity

Where monitoring identifies nonconformity or underperformance, corrective action is initiated.

⸻

## 9. Change Management

Changes to controlled processes are managed to ensure continued conformity by:
- Assessing the purpose and impact of proposed changes
- Evaluating associated risks and resource needs
- Approving changes before implementation
- Communicating changes to affected parties

Temporary or emergency changes are controlled and reviewed retrospectively.

⸻

## 10. Records and Documentation

Records demonstrating process control are maintained in accordance with IMS document and records control procedures. These records may include:
- Approved procedures and work instructions
- Risk assessments and control measures
- Monitoring and performance data
- Audit findings and corrective actions

Records are retained, protected, and disposed of in line with organisational requirements.

⸻

## 11. Review and Continual Improvement

The effectiveness of process controls is reviewed through:
- Ongoing monitoring and reporting
- Internal audits
- Management review
- Feedback from stakeholders and personnel

Opportunities for improvement are identified and implemented to enhance efficiency, compliance, and performance across the IMS.

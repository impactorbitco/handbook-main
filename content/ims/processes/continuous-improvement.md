## 1. Purpose

This procedure defines how the organisation identifies, manages, and implements continual improvement within the Integrated Management System (IMS). The purpose is to enhance the effectiveness, suitability, and performance of the IMS by systematically learning from experience, performance data, and stakeholder feedback.

Continual improvement ensures that the IMS evolves in line with organisational objectives, changing risks, stakeholder expectations, and applicable requirements.

⸻

## 2. Scope

This procedure applies to:
- All processes, activities, and controls within the IMS
- All personnel, including employees, contractors, and relevant third parties
- Improvements related to quality, environmental performance, information security, health and safety, and governance

⸻

## 3. Principles of Continual Improvement

The organisation’s approach to continual improvement is based on the following principles:
- Proactive identification of improvement opportunities
- Risk-based and evidence-led decision-making
- Learning from successes, failures, and near misses
- Incremental and sustainable change
- Shared responsibility across the organisation

⸻

## 4. Sources of Improvement Opportunities

Improvement opportunities may arise from:
- Monitoring and measurement of process performance
- Internal and external audit findings
- Incidents, nonconformities, and near misses
- Client and stakeholder feedback
- Management reviews
- Changes in legal, regulatory, or strategic context
- Employee suggestions and lessons learned

All sources are considered valid inputs to the continual improvement process.

⸻

## 5. Identification and Logging of Improvements

Improvement opportunities are:
- Identified through routine activities or specific reviews
- Logged in an improvement register or equivalent system
- Described clearly, including the issue, opportunity, or desired outcome

Opportunities may range from minor process enhancements to significant systemic changes.

⸻

## 6. Assessment and Prioritisation

Identified improvement opportunities are assessed to:
- Understand potential benefits and impacts
- Evaluate associated risks and resource requirements
- Determine priority based on significance, urgency, and alignment with objectives

Not all improvement opportunities require formal action; decisions are proportionate and documented where appropriate.

⸻

## 7. Planning and Implementation

For approved improvement actions, the organisation:
- Defines clear actions, responsibilities, and timescales
- Assesses risks associated with implementation
- Allocates necessary resources
- Implements changes in a controlled manner

Where improvements involve changes to processes or controls, change management procedures are applied.

⸻

## 8. Corrective Action and Effectiveness Review

Where improvement actions address incidents or nonconformities:
- Root causes are identified and addressed
- Corrective actions are implemented to prevent recurrence
- Effectiveness of actions is reviewed after implementation

If actions are not effective, further improvement measures are defined.

⸻

## 9. Monitoring and Measurement

The organisation monitors improvement activities by:
- Tracking progress against agreed actions and milestones
- Measuring impact on performance indicators where applicable
- Reviewing outcomes through audits or management reviews

Evidence of improvement is retained to demonstrate effectiveness and learning.

⸻

## 10. Communication and Learning

Continual improvement is supported through:
- Communication of improvements and lessons learned
- Sharing good practice across teams
- Encouraging employee involvement and suggestions

This supports a culture of openness, learning, and accountability.

⸻

## 11. Management Review and Strategic Alignment

Top management reviews continual improvement activities to:
- Assess overall IMS performance and maturity
- Ensure improvements align with strategic objectives
- Identify systemic issues or opportunities
- Prioritise future improvement initiatives

Outputs from management review inform planning and resource allocation.

⸻

## 12. Records and Documentation

Records related to continual improvement include:
- Improvement registers and action logs
- Corrective action records
- Review findings and outcomes
- Evidence of implemented improvements

All records are controlled in accordance with IMS document and records control procedures.

Green Orbit Digital is committed to building a more sustainable internet. As a purpose-driven creative agency focused on space-enabled solutions for climate and sustainability, we believe digital design must be environmentally responsible, inclusive, and future-focused. This statement outlines our approach to sustainable web design and our ongoing alignment with the [W3C Sustainable Web Design Guidelines](https://w3c.github.io/sustainableweb-wsg/).

# **Our Commitment to Web Sustainability**

We recognise that the internet contributes significantly to global carbon emissions and resource consumption. In response, Green Orbit Digital is actively embedding sustainability principles into the planning, design, development, and deployment of all our digital platforms.

Our approach is holistic, combining environmental, social, and economic responsibility to ensure our digital services contribute to a cleaner, more inclusive web.

# **Principles We Follow**

We design, build and manage websites in alignment with the following sustainability principles:

- **Efficient**: We optimise for low resource use to minimise energy consumption across devices, networks, and data centres.
- **Resilient**: We create digital services that are durable, accessible in low-connectivity environments, and maintainable over time.
- **Open**: We support interoperability, open standards, and freedom from unnecessary lock-in.
- **Regenerative**: We aim to not only reduce harm, but also create positive environmental and social impacts.
- **Just**: We advocate for equity and inclusion in digital spaces, ensuring that sustainability efforts uplift all communities.

# **What We Do in Practice**

Green Orbit Digital implements the W3C’s Sustainable Web Design Guidelines in the following areas:

1. **User Experience and Design**

- Streamlined design with purpose-driven content to reduce data transfer.
- Prioritising lightweight assets, compressed imagery, and efficient media.
- Dark mode and reduced motion options to support energy efficiency and accessibility.
- Designing for mobile-first and low-bandwidth contexts.

2. **Development Practices**

- Clean, efficient code that avoids unnecessary scripts and dependencies.
- Lazy loading and static site generation where appropriate.
- Embracing progressive enhancement to support older and lower-powered devices.

3. **Hosting and Infrastructure**

- Partnering with [Green Web Foundation](https://www.thegreenwebfoundation.org/) verified green hosts and renewable energy-powered services.
- Minimising use of CDNs that rely on fossil-fuel-powered infrastructure.
- Evaluating server load, uptime efficiency, and global delivery to reduce digital waste.

4. **Carbon Awareness and Transparency**

- Monitoring emissions with tools like [Website Carbon Calculator](https://www.websitecarbon.com/), [Ecoping](https://www.ecoping.earth/), and [Beacon](https://www.thegreenwebfoundation.org/tools/beacon/).
- Publishing key statistics on our digital carbon footprint annually.
- Setting reduction targets aligned with Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi).

5. **Governance and Collaboration**

- Embedding digital sustainability in internal workflows and client deliverables.
- Advocating for responsible digital design across the creative and space sectors.
- Aligning with ISO 14001 (environmental management) and ISO 20121 (sustainable events).
- Participating in initiatives such as Clean Creatives, SME Climate Hub, and The Ethical Move.

# **Measuring Our Impact**

- **Website Carbon Score**: Cleaner than 54% of websites tested
- **Hosting**: 100% renewable-powered verified by Green Web Foundation
- **Optimisation Goals**: Reduce page weight below 1MB, aim for <1g CO₂ per page view

We review and update our sustainability performance quarterly and integrate improvements iteratively.

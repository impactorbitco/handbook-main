## **Mental Health Awareness Statement**

1. Why is awareness of Mental Health important at GitLab?
    - It can affect any and all of us. Statistics indicate that [1 in 4](https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/28-09-2001-the-world-health-report-2001-mental-disorders-affect-one-in-four-people) of us will be affected by mental or neurological disorders at some point in our life. That said, we are all subject to periods where we or those around us find the “the normal stresses of life” harder than usual to deal with.
    - The more we are aware of mental health, the more inclusive we are. That will help encourage any colleagues currently experiencing mental health issues to talk about it.
    - Our business at its core is a group of people working together towards a common goal. With awareness of what might affect our colleagues, we are better equipped to help them if they do discuss it with us and therefore help our business.
    - Mental health has so much emotional baggage as a topic that it can initially seem scary to talk about. Promoting mental health awareness helps to remove the stigma and taboos associated with it.
    - GitLab can offer “productive and fruitful” work for all of our employees. That should not be [underestimated](https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwitr7eP18_XAhWIORoKHY2_CA4QFggrMAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcardinal-management.co.uk%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2016%2F04%2FBurton-Waddell-is-work-good-for-you.pdf&usg=AOvVaw0ROXJdWquGML5bIsBEIRLo).
    - In the cold-light of business metrics, the healthier we are, [the more productive we are](https://www.rand.org/randeurope/research/projects/workplace-health-well-being-productivity.html).
2. At GitLab we strive to create a stigma-free workplace. In accordance with the National Mental Health Association and the National Council for Behavioral Health we would like to:
    - Educate employees about the signs and symptoms of mental health disorders.
    - Encourage employees to talk about stress, workload, family commitments, and other issues.
    - Communicate that mental illnesses are real, common, and treatable.
    - Discourage stigmatizing language, including hurtful labels such as “crazy,” “loony” or “nuts.”
    - Help employees transition back to work after they take leave.
    - Encourage consultation with our employee assistance programs.
3. What are we doing to get there?
    - Talk about mental health issues and ideas in the #mental_health_aware Slack channel.
    - GitLab would also like to encourage GitLab team members to take [time off](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/time-off-and-absence/time-off-types/) to properly take care of themselves. We encourage the team to go to yoga, take a long lunch, or anything else in their day to day life that assists in their mental and emotional well-being.
    - In addition to our current EAP programs available for employees, we encourage GitLab team members to take a look at these [Resources for Employees](https://www.workplacestrategiesformentalhealth.com/topic/Resources-for-employees) for insight into reclaiming well-being at work, off work, and return to work.
    - We believe that our values and culture lends itself to being able to discuss mental health open and honestly without being stigmatized, but let’s work together to make it even more inclusive. For example, Finding the right words:
        - “How can we help you do your job?”
        - “You’re not your usual self.”
        - “Do you want to talk about it?”
        - “It’s always OK to ask for help.”
        - “It’s hard for me to understand exactly what you’re going through, but I can see that it’s distressing for you.”

Additionally, team members should learn to [recognize burnout](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/time-off-and-absence/time-off-types/) and to [prevent it](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2022/05/03/preventing-burnout-a-managers-toolkit/).

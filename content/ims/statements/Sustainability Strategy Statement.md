# **Space Sustainability Statement**

At Green Orbit Digital, we are dedicated to fostering sustainable practices that ensure the long-term safety, accessibility, and viability of space activities. As the space sector expands, it is imperative that all stakeholders adhere to principles of sustainability to protect Earth’s orbital environment and maintain its benefits for future generations.

Our commitment aligns with the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs (UNOOSA) Guidelines for the Long-Term Sustainability of Outer Space Activities (LTS Guidelines). These guidelines provide a comprehensive framework to promote responsible behaviour in outer space, addressing issues such as space debris mitigation, equitable access, and the preservation of orbital environments.

This statement outlines our alignment with the UNOOSA LTS Guidelines and our proactive measures to advance space sustainability.

Proposed framework for space sustainability evaluation in reference to the traditional Earth sustainability assessment framework across four domains: (1) pollution, (2) resource depletion, (3) landscape alteration, and (4) space environmental justice, as well as the example indicators under each of these domains in relation to three assessment levels: (1) resource uses and emissions, (2) mid-point, and (3) end-point.

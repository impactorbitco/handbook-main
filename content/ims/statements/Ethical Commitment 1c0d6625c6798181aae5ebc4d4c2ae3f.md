Our overarching goal is to build a company that not only thrives in the digital landscape but also contributes significantly to the betterment of our global community.

# **Our Impact Criteria**

***Positive Screening (GREEN)***

We actively seek projects that:

- Promote a healthy natural environment, including clean energy and non-toxic goods.
- Reduce the consumption of physical goods and minimise waste.
- Raise awareness about crucial environmental, social, and ethical issues.
- Advocate for animal welfare and conservation.
- Address injustice and contribute to creating a fair and well-functioning society.
- Provide education and encourage healthy lifestyles.

We also prioritise working with client organisations that:

- Champion fairness and equality in the workplace.
- Foster positive, long-term relationships, treating our team as equal partners.
- Ensure fair compensation for all workers.
- Maintain strong, well-documented social and environmental policies.
- Hold certifications such as Certified B Corp, social enterprise, non-profit, or public organisation status.

***Negative Screening (RED)***

We conscientiously avoid projects associated with:

- Animal agriculture and animal products.
- Arms, ammunition, and conflict.
- Discrimination or extremism.
- Fossil fuels.
- Gambling.
- Genetically modified crops (GM).
- Predatory financial services, such as loan sharks.

- Unhealthy products aimed at children.

We also steer clear of client organisations with:

- Abusive staff towards our team or other suppliers.
- A proven record of lobbying against positive change.
- A proven record of environmental or human rights abuses.

***Grey Areas (GREY)***

In acknowledgment of the complexity of real-life scenarios, we understand that certain projects may not neatly fit into positive or negative categories. In these grey areas, where ambiguity arises, we openly discuss potential projects within the team and collectively make informed decisions.

# **Continuous Evaluation**

Our commitment to ethical practices extends beyond new client onboarding; we continually evaluate existing client relationships. Ensuring alignment with our values and team needs, we regularly assess:

- Enjoyment and respect in working relationships.
- Alignment with client needs and fulfilment of their requirements.
- General profitability.

This ongoing evaluation, coupled with project retrospectives, enables us to uphold our ethical standards and maintain meaningful partnerships.

As a responsible business, it is important to us that we represent the diversity of our people and communities, and that we create an inclusive innovation ecosystem in the UK in which everyone can reach their full potential.

It is vital that we monitor and analyse diversity information so that we can ensure that our processes, events and communications are fair, transparent, promote equality of opportunity for all, and do not have an adverse impact on any particular group.

Your cooperation in providing us with accurate data will ensure that we design and apply policies and processes that embrace a diverse and inclusive environment.

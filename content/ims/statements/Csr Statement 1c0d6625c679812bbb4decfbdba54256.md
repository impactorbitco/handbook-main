# **Scope**

This CSR policy applies to **Green Orbit Digital** and its subsidiaries, partners, suppliers, and all stakeholders involved in our operations. Our commitment to CSR is reflected across our entire value chain, from product development to the communities where we operate.

Our CSR efforts extend beyond compliance with laws and regulations. We actively promote transparency and accountability at all levels, ensuring that everyone in the Green Orbit Digital ecosystem is aligned with our commitment to sustainable and ethical business practices.

# **Policy Elements Based on Carroll’s CSR Pyramid**

Green Orbit Digital’s CSR strategy is rooted in **Carroll’s CSR Pyramid**, with each of the four levels of responsibility (Economic, Legal, Ethical, and Philanthropic) playing a critical role in shaping our approach to CSR. These four dimensions form the foundation of our CSR framework, and our policies and actions align with each level’s core responsibilities.

---

**1. Economic Responsibilities (Foundation)**

At the base of Carroll’s pyramid are economic responsibilities, which form the foundation of any business. For Green Orbit Digital, this means ensuring the financial sustainability of our company while contributing to the broader economy. We are committed to operating in a way that generates long-term value for our shareholders and stakeholders alike.

We avoid exploiting resources, and we commit to delivering value to our customers, employees, and the communities in which we operate. Our profit-generation strategies will always prioritise long-term sustainability over short-term gains.
- **Fair market practices:** Green Orbit Digital seeks to establish itself as a market leader in sustainability, with a focus on developing solutions that meet the needs of our customers without compromising the environment or social values. Our products and services are designed with consideration for their impact on society and the economy.

By focusing on these economic responsibilities, we ensure that our business operations not only remain profitable but also contribute positively to the economy and society.

---

**3. Ethical Responsibilities (Expectations)**

The ethical level of CSR focuses on doing what is right, even if it is not required by law. These responsibilities go beyond compliance and are often shaped by societal expectations of how a business should operate ethically.

- **Commitment to human rights:** Green Orbit Digital is dedicated to safeguarding and promoting human rights across our operations. This includes ensuring that our suppliers, partners, and employees are treated with fairness and respect and that their basic human rights are protected. We work diligently to prevent any form of human rights abuse within our value chain.

Green Orbit Digital is committed to creating an inclusive work environment where individuals of all backgrounds, genders, races, and nationalities have equal opportunities.

- **Environmental ethics:** Beyond legal obligations, Green Orbit Digital proactively seeks to minimise our environmental impact by adopting green technologies and sustainable practices in every aspect of our operations. This includes reducing waste, conserving energy, and using environmentally friendly materials where possible.

These ethical responsibilities form a key part of our identity as a responsible business. We aim to lead by example in all our operations, setting a high bar for ethical behaviour in the industry.

Philanthropy refers to the voluntary actions businesses can take to improve society, going beyond the minimum requirements of the law and ethics.

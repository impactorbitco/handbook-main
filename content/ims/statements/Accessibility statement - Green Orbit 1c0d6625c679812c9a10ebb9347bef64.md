This website (wholegraindigital.com) is run by Scamper Limited, a UK limited company trading as Wholegrain Digital. We’re a web design agency based at Somerset House in London.

We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website. We’ve started by trying to ensure that our website content is clearly presented, well structured, clutter free and written without jargon.

In addition, we’ve tried to ensure that the design and functionality of the website supports those who may have challenges accessing web content. For example, that means you should be able to:

- Read all text without needing to change colours or fonts
- Zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen
- Navigate most of the website using just a keyboard
- Navigate most of the website using speech recognition software
- Listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver).

[AbilityNet](https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/) has advice on making your device easier to use if you have a disability.

## **How accessible is this website?**

We are trying to ensure that our whole website is fully accessible to everyone, but we know that we are not perfect.

Some aspects of the website that we know are not fully accessible are:

- You cannot modify the line height or spacing of text
- We rarely attach files to our website, but it is possible that we may have old files such as PDF and Powerpoint slides attached that are not fully accessible to screen reader software
- Some embedded video streams may not have captions
- Some images in old content may not have alt tags, or may not have meaningful alt tags
- Some of our secondary brand colours do not have a sufficiently high contrast ratio.

# **What should you do if you cannot access parts of this website?**

If you need information on this website in a different format, please contact us to discuss your needs and we will do our best to help:

- Email eat@wholegraindigital.com

We’ll consider your request and get back to you in 5 working days.

# **Report accessibility problems with this website**

We’re always looking to improve the accessibility of this website and we know that it is not perfect. If you find any problems not listed on this page or think we’re not meeting accessibility requirements, please do let us know so that we can resolve any issues quickly.

To report an accessibility issue, contact:

Tom Greenwood, Managing Director on 02071128240 or email [eat@wholegraindigital.com](mailto:eat@wholegraindigital.com).

# **Visiting us in person**

We love meeting people face to face. If you would like to visit us in person, please contact us to make an appointment and notify us of any accessibility requirements. We will do our best to ensure that we make visiting us as easy as possible. For general information about accessibility when visiting us at Somerset House, [please see this article on the Somerset House website](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.somersethouse.org.uk/accessibility&sa=D&ust=1570030408248000&usg=AFQjCNGombOglUsVkRcECOqTq7-zR8jEdQ).

## **Technical information about this website’s accessibility**

We are committed to making our websites accessible.

This website is partially compliant with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) AA standard, due to the non-compliances listed below.

# **Non compliance with the accessibility regulations**

The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.

**Image alt tags**

Some images do not have a text alternative, or have a text alternative that is not meaningful to the user, so people using a screen reader cannot access the information. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.1.1 (non-text content).

When we publish new content we’ll make sure our use of images meets accessibility standards. We will also be updating images on all trafficked pages (based on analytics data) by the end of 2019. If you find an image without an appropriate alt tag, please do let us know.

**Colour contrast**

Some of our secondary brand colours, used mainly for category links do not have a sufficiently high contrast ratio when displayed on a non-white background. The same problem occurs in some places where a background image is on a portfolio tile. There are instances of this throughout the website including the homepage and blog page.

We have tried to minimise these instances and are currently working on an updated colour scheme and portfolio tile design to solve these issues. This should be resolved in late 2019.

**Navigation and accessing information**

There are some instances where anchor links exist but do not have an associated anchor point. This is a legacy issue that will be resolved as soon as we have time, but by December 2019 at the latest.

# **Content that’s not within the scope of the accessibility regulations**

**PDFs and other documents**

Older PDFs, Word documents or presentation slides may not meet accessibility standards – for example, they may not be structured so they’re accessible to a screen reader. This does not meet WCAG 2.1 success criterion 4.1.2 (name, role value).

None of our PDFs and Word documents are essential to providing our services. We will aim to ensure that new documents are fully accessible, we will not be updated old documents.

**Live video**

Most videos embedded on our website are not controlled directly by us. Some of them (e.g. from YouTube or WordPress.tv) may not have captions. In these cases, this fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.2.4 (captions – live).

As we do not control the content of these videos, we are not able add captions. In cases where we add our own videos in the future, we will try to ensure that captions are provided.

## **How we tested this website**

This website was last tested on 1st October 2019. The test was carried out by our in-house developers using [https://pa11y.org/](https://pa11y.org/). We tested the 5 unique pages with the highest traffic.

## **What we’re doing to improve accessibility**

We are currently updating our brand colour palette to resolve colour contrast issues and will be redeveloping most website templates in late 2019. In this process we aim to eliminate all issues with WCAG2.1 AA compliance from the main pages of our website.

We will continue to monitor older content using Google Analytics and try to update this content where issues are identified.

This will be an ongoing process and we appreciate any input provided by our website users to help us ensure that we make the website as accessible as possible.

### Reporting accessibility problems with this website

If you find any problems not listed on this page or think we’re not meeting accessibility requirements, email the web team: [web@ukri.org](mailto:web@ukri.org)

### Enforcement procedure

The Equality and Human Rights Commission is responsible for enforcing the [public sector bodies (websites and mobile applications) (No.2) accessibility regulations 2018](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/852/contents/made).

If you make a complaint and you’re not happy with how we respond, you can contact the [Equality Advisory and Support Service](https://www.equalityadvisoryservice.com/).

## Technical information about this website’s accessibility

UKRI is committed to making its website accessible, in accordance with the public sector bodies (websites and mobile applications) (No. 2) accessibility regulations 2018.

This website is partially compliant with the [web content accessibility guidelines version 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) AA standard, due to certain non-compliances and exemptions.

### Non-accessible content

The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.

### Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations: PDFs and other documents

Many of our PDFs and other document types may not be suitable for users of assistive technology.

We are developing a document format using html web pages, which will be more accessible than PDFs.

We are working with suppliers and third parties to ensure that the accessibility of documents is planned for at creation.

We are often required to publish documents quickly to the website and plan to retrospectively publish an accessible version once one is available.

Where documents are not in the format you need, you can request an alternative by emailing [web@ukri.org](mailto:web@ukri.org)

### Disproportionate burden: PDFs and other documents

We have assessed that fixing every document on ukri.org would be a [disproportionate burden](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/952/regulation/7/made) within the meaning of the accessibility regulations.

We believe that the benefit of assigning staff to immediately fix all documents on ukri.org would not be justified, as the documents have a low level of usage.

We have prioritised ensuring the top 5% most viewed documents on ukri.org are in an accessible format.

### Content that’s not within the scope of the regulations: PDFs and other documents

Some of our older PDFs and Microsoft Office documents may not meet accessibility standards. For example, they may not be marked up so they are accessible to a screen reader. These include historic reports and case studies.

The accessibility regulations [do not require us to fix PDFs or other documents published before 23 September 2018.](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/952/regulation/4/made) We will not replace these documents with accessible versions.

Where possible, any new PDFs or Microsoft Office documents we publish will meet accessibility standards. Where this is not possible, we will endeavour to make the information available in an accessible format.

If you need documents in a different format like accessible PDF, large print please email [web@ukri.org](mailto:web@ukri.org)

### Content that’s not within the scope of the regulations: live video

We do not plan to add captions to live video streams because this is [exempt from meeting accessibility regulations](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/952/regulation/4/made).

## What we’re doing to improve accessibility

We used the [Digital Accessibility Centre](https://digitalaccessibilitycentre.org/) to test the accessibility of the site for compliance with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) version 2.1.

As we continue to develop the website and its content, we will re-audit and test the website for accessibility on a regular basis.

## Preparation of this accessibility statement

## With Whom does Impact Orbit Creative Group Share My Personal Data?
We may share each of the categories of Personal Data we collect with the types of third-parties described below, for the following business purposes:

_Sharing with Users and the Public:_ We may share your Personal Data with other users of the Services and with the public if you choose to make your SaaS Profile public. You have control over what information is public; however, your name and username will always be displayed. If you do not want to disclose your real name, please use a pseudonym or other alias in your profile and username. To change your settings, go to User Settings in your profile. You should also be aware that any information you share as part of a project, blog, website etc. may be publicly available and you should consider this carefully when interacting with the Services. Also, we may collect and share public community contribution metrics as part of our Evangelist Program.

_Sharing with Managed Accounts and Administrators:_ If you have created a Impact Orbit Creative Group account with your corporate email address, we may share your Personal Data with your Company if your Company enters into a commercial relationship with Impact Orbit Creative Group. If this happens, then your use of the software and your account is subject to the terms and any data protection agreement between your Company and Impact Orbit Creative Group.

In the event you change the email address on your account from a corporate email address to a personal email address and, thereafter, your Company enters into a commercial relationship with Impact Orbit Creative Group, your Personal Data related to that account will not be shared with your Company. Impact Orbit Creative Group will not link an account to a Company based on retroactive use of a corporate email.

In addition, if you choose to become a member of a group, your username, email address, IP address, the date when access was granted, the date when access expires, your access role, and audit logs containing information related to your actions in the group will be shared with the owners of that group.

_Sharing with Service Providers:_ We share your Personal Data with our service providers. These are companies who provide services on our behalf, including in the areas of cloud hosting, marketing, advertising, ad measurement, social engagement, analytics, support ticketing, credit card processing, AI and ML, security, and other such similar services. These companies are subject to contractual requirements that govern the security and confidentiality of your information.

For example, we use analytics providers, such as Google Analytics and Google Signals, to help us understand the operation and performance of our Services and Stripe for payment, analytics, and other business services.. To learn about how Google uses and shares data it collects through its services, please visit https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/. You can learn more about Stripe and its processing activities via their privacy policy at stripe.com/privacy. In addition, please visit our Sub-Processors page to see the list of our Sub-Processors that we use in order to provide customer support, host the Services, and provide key product features.

_Sharing with Partners and Resellers:_ Impact Orbit Creative Group works with third-parties who provide sales, consulting, support and technical services for our Services. Where permitted and with your consent (if required), we may share your data with these partners and resellers.

_Sharing with Affiliated Companies:_ Impact Orbit Creative Group will share information collected with companies owned and operated by us.

_Sharing for Fraud and Prevention Abuse:_ We may share your information when we have a good faith belief that the disclosure is necessary to prevent fraud, abuse of our services, defend against attacks, and to protect the safety of Impact Orbit Creative Group and our users. For example, we may share your name and phone number with service providers to facilitate an identity verification call or SMS text for fraud prevention.

_Law Enforcement:_ Impact Orbit Creative Group may disclose Personal Data or other information we collect about you to law enforcement if required in response to a valid subpoena, court order, search warrant, a similar government order, or when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to protect our property or rights, or those of third-parties or the public at large.

_Merger or Acquisition:_ We may share your Personal Data if we are involved in a merger, sale, or acquisition of corporate entities or business units. If any such change of ownership happens, we will ensure that it is under terms that preserve the confidentiality of your Personal Data, and we will notify you on our website or by email before any transfer of your Personal Data.

Sharing Personal Data Across National Borders
Our Services are hosted in the United States and information we collect will be stored and processed on our servers in the United States. Our employees, contractors, affiliated organizations, service providers, and sub-processors that process Personal Data may be located in the United States or other countries outside of your home country. If you reside in the EEA, United Kingdom, or Switzerland, and we transfer information about you to a jurisdiction that has not been found by the European Commission to have adequate data protections, we will use available safeguards and legal mechanisms to help ensure your rights and protections, including using Standard Contractual Clauses or obtaining your consent.

For our customers whose use of the Impact Orbit Creative Group Websites and Services involves the processing of Personal Data from Japan, Impact Orbit Creative Group will transfer Personal Data originating in Japan to both its EEA and non-EEA affiliates, such as Impact Orbit Creative Group, Inc. in the United States. To make this transfer, Impact Orbit Creative Group relies on the Japan Personal Information Protection Commision’s adequacy decisions about the Personal Data protection system of the EEA and the United Kingdom, or the transfer will be made in accordance with our intra-company data transfer agreements that provide for obligations equivalent to those as stated under the APPIJ.

## How does Impact Orbit Creative Group Secure My Personal Data?
We work hard to protect your Personal Data. We employ administrative, technical, and physical security controls where appropriate, to protect your information from unauthorised access or destruction. For more information on our security practices please see: Technical and Organizational Security Measures for Impact Orbit Creative Group.com.

Except to host the Services, Impact Orbit Creative Group does not process Personal Data in private groups or projects unless the following situations arise: to maintain security or to remediate a security incident; to scan for malware and vulnerabilities that violate the Website Terms of Use; to comply with our legal obligations; to ensure the availability of the Services; to provide support to a repository owner upon request; or on the basis of your consent.

### Data Retention
In order to protect your Personal Data, Impact Orbit Creative Group will only retain your Personal Data for as long as your account is active or as needed to perform our contractual obligations, provide you the Services, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, preserve legal rights, or enforce our agreements.

Impact Orbit Creative Group reserves the right to delete inactive accounts, projects, namespaces, and associated content. Impact Orbit Creative Group may deem an account, project, or namespace inactive based on various criteria, including, but not limited to, the account creation date, the last time there was a valid log-in, and the date of the last contribution. If we plan to delete your account or projects, we will provide advance notice by sending a message to the email address registered to your account. Impact Orbit Creative Group encourages you to utilise your account on occasion to avoid the risk of being deemed inactive. Impact Orbit Creative Group may also delete inactive or weak SSH keys to help keep your account safe. If you use Impact Orbit Creative Group’s chatbot feature on our Websites, a transcript of your live chat will be retained for 12-months.

## What are My Rights and Choices Regarding Personal Data?
You have the right to access, correct, restrict or delete your Personal Data, and to port your Personal Data to another company. While these rights may vary by jurisdiction, Impact Orbit Creative Group provides you with the same rights and choices, no matter where you live. We provide these rights free of charge unless your requests are manifestly unfounded and excessive.

You may exercise your choices and rights as follows:

- _To opt out of marketing communications:_ You may opt-out of email marketing by clicking the “unsubscribe” link located at the bottom of any marketing email you receive or by visiting our preference center and unsubscribing. You may opt-out of telemarketing by asking our call agent to place you on our Do-Not-Call list or by visiting our preference center and unsubscribing. You may opt-out of messenger application communications, such as WhatsApp, by making a request through an in-app message or visiting our preference center and unsubscribing from telemarketing. You may continue to receive transactional email messages about your account and the Service after you have unsubscribed.

- _To opt-out of Interest-based advertising:_ If you wish to opt-out of interest-based advertising, please visit the Cookies Policy to see your options.

- _Request a copy of your information:_ You may request a copy of the Personal Data that Impact Orbit Creative Group has about you.

- _Update your information:_ If you already have an account, you may access, update, or alter your user profile information by logging into your account and updating profile settings.

- _To delete your account:_ If you only want to delete your SaaS account, you may do so by logging into your account and going to the “Delete Account” option in your User Settings. If your intention is to delete your Personal Data across all systems, including your account, you need to fill out a Personal Data Request Form and select "Account Deletion (full)" in the "Request Type" dropdown menu. If your account is tied to a Company that has entered into a commercial relationship with Impact Orbit Creative Group, you will have to ask your Company administrator to remove your account from that corporate namespace before we can delete it. Once your account is no longer associated with that corporate namespace, Impact Orbit Creative Group will process your deletion request according to the process stated herein.

Be advised that if you allow your repository to be forked or cloned by making it public or by providing specific authorization, such repositories will fall outside the scope of your request for deletion. Impact Orbit Creative Group does not have the visibility into or the ability to delete your Personal Data across all forked or cloned repositories nor can we make such a communication to all third-parties on your behalf. As such, you must make your request to delete such repositories directly to those third-parties that you allowed to fork or clone your data.

Please note that due to the open source nature of our Services, we may retain limited Personal Data indefinitely in order to provide a transactional history. For example, if you provide your information in connection with a blog post or comment, we may display that information even if you have deleted your account as we do not automatically delete community posts. Also, if you contribute to a public project (not owned by Impact Orbit Creative Group), and you provide your Personal Data in connection with that contribution, your Personal Data will be embedded and publicly displayed with your contribution, and we will not be able to delete or erase it because doing so would break the project.

One exception to embedded information in a public project occurs when your Personal Data is added by you or someone else to the comments section of a public project. In such a case, your Personal Data will be redacted since removing this information from only the comments section will not break the project.

If you contribute to a Impact Orbit Creative Group owned project by commenting in, or creating an issue or merge request and you provide your Personal Data in connection with that contribution, your Personal Data associated with your contribution will be deleted and attributed to a ghost user. However, please note that if the content of the contribution contains Personal Data, this information would remain and you will need to submit a specific request to have this information deleted.

- _To port your projects:_ You may port your projects by either using the Export functionality provided within the SaaS product which will also include all metadata, or by cloning your repositories. To port your profile information, you may use the API.

- _To inform your Supervisory Authority:_ In the unlikely event you disagree with our handling of your request, you have the right to file a complaint with the competent supervisory authority in your jurisdiction, such as the Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens (+31)-(0)70 - 8888 500 in the Netherlands.

- _Appeals:_ If you are located in a state or country where you are granted the right to appeal Impact Orbit Creative Group's resolution of a data subject rights request, we will provide the specific information on how to appeal in our initial resolution letter to your request.

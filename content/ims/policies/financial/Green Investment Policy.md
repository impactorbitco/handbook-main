**1. Introduction**

Green Orbit Digital is deeply committed to fostering a sustainable future by funding projects that prioritise environmental sustainability, technological innovation, and responsible stewardship. Recognising the growing need for responsible finance, we aim to direct our financial resources—whether through direct investments, pension funds, or banking relationships—towards projects and initiatives that align with our core values of sustainability, social equity, and ethical responsibility. This Green Investment Policy outlines the principles, goals, and strategies we will employ to ensure that all investments—whether in projects, pension schemes, or banking arrangements—are in line with global sustainability standards and our long-term environmental objectives.

**2. Purpose**

The purpose of this Green Investment Policy is to:

- Provide a comprehensive framework for funding decisions across all financial channels, ensuring that all resources contribute to environmental sustainability.
- Align Green Orbit Digital’s investments and banking relationships with our broader mission to foster the responsible development of space technologies and other sectors that promote environmental and social benefits.
- Ensure that the company’s pension schemes, banking relationships, and investment strategies align with our environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria.
- Promote responsible business practices by encouraging partners, financial institutions, and banks to adopt green, ethical, and sustainable practices.

**3. Scope**

This policy applies to all financial activities of Green Orbit Digital, including:

- Direct investments in sustainable projects and startups focused on clean technologies, renewable energy, and environmental stewardship.
- Pension fund management, ensuring that employee retirement savings are invested in line with ESG principles.
- Banking relationships, including the management of corporate funds and working capital, ensuring that Green Orbit Digital only works with financial institutions that align with sustainability and responsible finance practices.

**4. Investment Principles**

Green Orbit Digital’s investment philosophy is grounded in the following core principles:

1. **Environmental Stewardship:** All investments must have a measurable, positive environmental impact. We prioritise projects that promote renewable energy, reduce carbon emissions, promote resource conservation, and ensure the protection of natural ecosystems.
2. **Social and Economic Equity:** We recognise that sustainability extends beyond the environment to include social responsibility. We seek investments that also address social equity, including projects that promote job creation, sustainable economic growth, and community development, particularly in underserved regions.
3. **Innovative and Scalable Solutions:** We focus on investing in companies and projects that offer innovative solutions to environmental problems. These solutions should be scalable, replicable, and able to make a long-term impact on the environment.
4. **Ethical Practices:** Green Orbit Digital only invests in businesses that operate with a strong ethical foundation, ensuring fair labour practices, transparent governance, and respect for human rights.
5. **Pension Fund Alignment:** We ensure that pension funds are invested in line with the company’s sustainability ethos, prioritising funds and asset managers that integrate ESG principles into their investment strategies and exclude industries that contribute to environmental harm or social injustice.
6. **Banking Relationships:** We engage with financial institutions that demonstrate a commitment to sustainable finance, with policies in place to support green projects and avoid financing environmentally harmful industries. We favour banking relationships with institutions that practice responsible lending, promote ESG-aligned financial products, and have transparent environmental policies.

1. **ESG Integration in Pension Fund Management:**
    - We ensure that pension fund investments are managed by asset managers who integrate ESG criteria into their investment decisions. This means that pension funds will not be invested in industries such as fossil fuels, deforestation, or weapons manufacturing but will instead focus on companies and funds that prioritise environmental sustainability, social equity, and good governance.
2. **Green Investment Options in Pension Schemes:**
    - Green Orbit Digital’s employees are encouraged to choose green investment options within their pension schemes, which may include funds focused on renewable energy, clean technologies, and sustainable infrastructure. These funds should generate competitive financial returns while aligning with our environmental sustainability goals.
3. **Negative Screening for Pension Funds:**
    - We apply negative screening to exclude investments in sectors that have significant adverse environmental or social impacts, including industries related to fossil fuels, mining, deforestation, or weapons production.

    - Green Orbit Digital supports active ownership strategies for its pension funds, engaging with companies in the portfolio to promote better sustainability practices. We encourage companies to improve their environmental, social, and governance performance, contributing to the overall sustainability of the financial markets.

3. **Transparent ESG Reporting:**
    - We require transparency from banks in their ESG performance, with regular reporting on their environmental policies, the impact of their financed projects, and their commitment to responsible lending.
4. **Banking Fees and Sustainability:**
    - Green Orbit Digital works with banks that prioritise low or no fees on services that support sustainability efforts, such as carbon offsetting, environmental impact investing, and financing for green businesses.
5. **Ethical Bank Selection:**
    - Green Orbit Digital works exclusively with financial institutions that uphold ethical banking practices, ensuring fair lending practices and avoiding involvement in sectors that promote social inequality or environmental degradation.

**8. Monitoring and Reporting**

Green Orbit Digital is committed to transparent monitoring and reporting of its green investments, including those made through pension funds and banking relationships. Regular reports will be produced to track the performance of investments, their environmental and social impact, and their alignment with Green Orbit Digital’s sustainability objectives.

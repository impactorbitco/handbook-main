2. **Durability and Longevity** – Prefer repairable, reusable, refurbishable, or recyclable items over disposable or single-use products.  
3. **Recycled and Recyclable Materials** – Prioritise recycled content and items that can be recycled at end-of-life, including packaging and office supplies.  
4. **Energy Efficiency** – Choose energy-efficient equipment, appliances, and electronics (e.g., Energy Star rated).  
5. **Non-Toxic and Low-Impact** – Avoid products with hazardous substances; prefer environmentally safe alternatives.  
6. **Fair Trade and Ethical Sourcing** – Select suppliers promoting fair labor standards, human rights, and environmental responsibility.  
7. **Local and Sustainable Sourcing** – Source locally or from suppliers demonstrating strong sustainability practices, including renewable energy and sustainable packaging.

- **Product Life Cycle** – Consider environmental impact across production, transport, use, and disposal.

## Introduction

### Background

Impact Orbit Creative Group is a sustainability-driven marketing agency focused on integrating eco-conscious solutions into the space industry. As a remote-first organisation, we are deeply committed to reducing our environmental impact while promoting social responsibility and strong governance practices. Our approach to ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) ensures that sustainability is embedded in every aspect of our operations, from internal practices to client interactions. We recognise that sustainability is not only a responsibility but a driving force for innovation, and we strive to lead by example in advancing sustainability across the space sector.

### Aims of the ESG Policy

The primary aim of Impact Orbit Creative Group’s ESG Policy is to define our strategy for integrating sustainable practices across all aspects of our business operations, ensuring that sustainability is at the heart of everything we do. This policy serves as a guiding framework for all stakeholders—including employees, clients, suppliers, and partners—committing us to contribute positively to the environment, society, and governance structures.

Our ESG goals are built around three key pillars:

- **Environmental Responsibility**: Implement sustainable business practices, optimise resource efficiency, support sustainable innovations, and actively drive initiatives that minimise our carbon footprint.
- **Social Responsibility**: Foster diversity, equity, and inclusion, ensure employee well-being and development, and encourage responsible marketing and community engagement.
- **Governance Excellence**: Maintain high ethical standards, transparency, accountability, and responsible decision-making across all operations.

This policy aligns with global sustainability standards, including the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and aims to drive meaningful change within the space industry and beyond.

### Success Factors

- **Supplier Selection:** Choose partners aligned with sustainability values to maintain a responsible supply chain.
- **Employee Engagement:** Provide education and resources to empower employees to make sustainable choices.
- **Stakeholder Communication:** Maintain transparent communication on sustainability objectives, progress, and challenges.
- **Continuous Improvement:** Regularly evaluate ESG goals and refine strategies based on stakeholder feedback and emerging trends.

### PDCA Model (Plan-Do-Check-Act)

- **Plan:** Define sustainability goals, identify improvement areas, set measurable targets, and develop action plans.
- **Do:** Implement sustainable practices across operations, client services, and supply chain management.
- **Check:** Monitor performance against KPIs, conduct audits, and gather stakeholder feedback.
- **Act:** Refine strategies and introduce new initiatives to continuously improve ESG performance.

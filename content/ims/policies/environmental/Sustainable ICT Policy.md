## **1. Introduction**

This policy outlines our commitment to ensuring all Information and Communication Technology (ICT) practices support environmental sustainability. It is aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the UK Government’s 25 Year Environment Plan, and best practices as outlined in Defra’s Sustainable ICT Guide.

## **2. Purpose**

To reduce the environmental footprint of our ICT activities, ensure responsible procurement and use of digital technologies, and contribute to a circular economy. This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and suppliers who use or manage ICT resources within the organisation.

## **3. Scope**

This policy covers the full lifecycle of ICT, including:

- Procurement and supply chain
- Device usage and energy efficiency
- Waste and end-of-life management
- Data storage and digital services
- Cloud computing
- Water and carbon footprint associated with ICT

## **4. Policy Commitments**

### 4.1 **Sustainable Procurement**

- Prioritise ICT suppliers with recognised environmental standards (e.g. ISO 14001, TCO Certified).
- Require lifecycle sustainability assessments during procurement.
- Embed sustainability criteria in all ICT tenders and contracts.

### 4.2 **Circular Economy Practices**

- Extend the life of ICT equipment through repair, reuse, and redeployment.
- Use refurbished or modular equipment where feasible.
- Establish take-back and recycling schemes with accredited e-waste providers.
- Adopt “urban mining” practices by recovering materials from old devices.

### 4.3 **Energy and Resource Efficiency**

- Opt for energy-efficient devices (Energy Star, EPEAT rated).
- Enable power-saving settings by default on all devices.
- Minimise energy consumption by consolidating servers and maximising virtualisation.
- Regularly monitor and report ICT energy usage.

### 4.4 **Cloud and Digital Services**

- Use cloud services with transparent sustainability credentials (e.g. renewable-powered data centres).
- Minimise unnecessary data duplication and storage.
- Implement digital clean-up routines to delete obsolete files and reduce storage costs and carbon emissions.

### 4.5 **Water and Ecological Impact**

- Evaluate suppliers’ water use in ICT manufacturing.
- Support technologies and partners that follow water governance and risk mitigation standards.
- Monitor the organisation’s ecological footprint from ICT and report annually.

### 4.6 **Compliance and Standards**

- Align ICT practices with ISO standards, particularly:
    - ISO 14001 (Environmental Management)
    - ISO/IEC 27001 (Information Security)
    - ISO 50001 (Energy Management)
- Ensure all stakeholders are aware of and comply with these standards.

### 4.7 **Training and Engagement**

- Provide staff with training on sustainable ICT use.
- Promote awareness campaigns about digital sustainability.
- Encourage staff-led initiatives to reduce digital waste.

### 4.8 **Reporting and Continuous Improvement**

- Measure and report ICT sustainability performance annually.
- Review this policy biannually to incorporate emerging best practices and technologies.
- Set and review targets for ICT-related carbon and energy reduction.

## **5. Roles and Responsibilities**

- **ICT Manager**: Oversees implementation of this policy and sustainability goals.
- **Procurement Team**: Ensures all ICT purchases comply with sustainability criteria.

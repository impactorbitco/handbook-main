We are committed to making The Better Business Summit an event that is accessible, sustainable and impactful. We want this to be something other event organisers can recreate so that the impact of these choices goes further than the Better Business Summit.

# Our Nature Commitment

Adding Nature to the board of directors of The Better Business Network meant that we have legally enshrined nature in the rules of the company, along with a role on the board and a vote.

This means that as a company when making strategic decisions, we are always considering what impact our approach would have on the natural world. The aim of this is to make better informed decisions around the topics that impact nature, our employees, members and stakeholders.

At the 2023 Better Business Summit we gave nature a seat on all our panel discussions.

At the 2024 Better Business Summit we gave nature a voice on all our panel discussions and representatives from the Better Business Network spoke on behalf of nature.

Since then we have partnered with 1% for the Planet who provide representatives from High Impact Non-profits at all of our Catalyst Conversations, and who will represent Nature at our 2025 event.

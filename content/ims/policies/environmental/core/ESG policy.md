## Introduction

### Background
Impact Orbit Creative Group is a sustainability-driven marketing agency focused on integrating eco-conscious solutions into the space industry. As a remote-first organisation, we are committed to reducing environmental impact while promoting social responsibility and strong governance practices. Our ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) approach ensures sustainability is embedded across all operations—from internal practices to client interactions. We recognise sustainability as both a responsibility and a driver for innovation and aim to lead by example in advancing sustainability across the space sector.

### Aims of the ESG Policy
The ESG Policy defines our strategy for integrating sustainable practices across all aspects of business operations. It guides all stakeholders—employees, clients, suppliers, and partners—to contribute positively to the environment, society, and governance structures.  

**ESG Pillars:**
- **Environmental Responsibility:** Implement sustainable business practices, optimise resource efficiency, support sustainable innovations, and minimise carbon footprint.
- **Social Responsibility:** Foster diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), ensure employee well-being, and encourage responsible marketing and community engagement.
- **Governance Excellence:** Maintain high ethical standards, transparency, accountability, and responsible decision-making.

### Success Factors
- **Supplier Selection:** Partner with organisations aligned with sustainability values.
- **Employee Engagement:** Educate and empower employees to make sustainable choices.
- **Stakeholder Communication:** Maintain transparency on sustainability objectives, progress, and challenges.
- **Continuous Improvement:** Regularly evaluate ESG goals and refine strategies based on feedback and emerging trends.

### PDCA Model (Plan-Do-Check-Act)
- **Plan:** Define sustainability goals, identify improvement areas, and set measurable targets.
- **Do:** Implement sustainable practices across operations, client services, and supply chain.
- **Check:** Monitor KPIs, conduct audits, and gather stakeholder feedback.
- **Act:** Refine strategies and introduce new initiatives to improve ESG performance.

## Introduction

At **Impact Orbit Creative Group**, we recognise the crucial role that businesses play in mitigating climate change. This policy outlines our commitment to reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across all operations and contributing to global efforts to limit environmental impact and global warming.

## Scope

This policy applies to all employees, contractors, suppliers, partners, and operations that may influence our greenhouse gas emissions.

## Commitment

1. **Net Zero Ambition**  
   We are committed to achieving **Net Zero emissions by 2040**, in line with science-based targets to limit global warming to 1.5°C.

2. **Emission Reduction Targets**  
   - 50% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030  
   - 90% reduction in absolute emissions across all scopes by 2040  

3. **Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy**  
   - Adopt energy-efficient technologies and operational practices.  
   - Optimise energy use through regular audits.  
   - Transition to renewable energy sources wherever possible, including exploring on-site generation.  

4. **Sustainable Transportation**  
   - Promote low-carbon commuting, including public transport, cycling, walking, and carpooling.  
   - Transition company vehicles to low-emission alternatives.  
   - Optimise logistics to minimise emissions across the supply chain.  

5. **Waste Reduction and Circular Practices**  
   - Minimise waste and maximise recycling and reuse.  
   - Source products and services with low carbon footprints.  
   - Encourage suppliers and partners to adopt sustainable practices.  

6. **Employee Engagement and Training**  
   - Provide regular training on carbon reduction and climate change awareness.  
   - Empower employees to participate in sustainability initiatives.  
   - Recognise and reward contributions to emission reduction efforts.  

7. **Digital Sustainability**  
   - Optimise cloud storage and IT infrastructure using energy-efficient, renewable-powered providers.  
   - Implement device lifecycle management and eliminate digital waste.  

## Baseline Emissions

Emissions are measured in **tonnes of CO2 equivalent (CO2e)** following the GHG Protocol corporate standard. We monitor:  
- **Scope 1:** Direct emissions from owned or controlled sources  
- **Scope 2:** Indirect emissions from purchased electricity, heat, or steam  
- **Scope 3:** Other indirect emissions, including supply chain and business travel  

## Carbon Reduction Measures

### 1. Facilities and Operations
- Upgrade lighting, heating, and cooling systems to energy-efficient models.  
- Optimise operational processes to reduce energy consumption.  

### 2. Travel and Commuting
- Support remote working and virtual collaboration.  
- Incentivise low-carbon travel choices.  
- Establish sustainable travel policies for business trips.  

### 3. Supply Chain
- Engage suppliers to collect emissions data and promote reductions.  
- Encourage suppliers to set science-based emission reduction targets.  
- Implement sustainable procurement practices.  

## Monitoring, Reporting, and Transparency

- Measure and report emissions quarterly.  
- Review progress against reduction targets annually.  
- Update the carbon management plan regularly.  
- Publicly disclose emissions and progress to stakeholders.  

## Governance

The **Board of Directors** reviews this policy quarterly and updates it annually to ensure continuous improvement, alignment with environmental goals, and compliance with relevant standards. Progress is communicated to employees, clients, and partners.

## Training and Awareness

- Conduct regular workshops and briefings on carbon reduction strategies.  
- Provide quarterly updates on performance against emission targets.  
- Train staff on new sustainable technologies and operational practices.  

## Partnerships and Collaboration

- Participate in industry initiatives to share best practices and align methodologies.  
- Support collective reporting and climate action with industry peers.  
- Collaborate with partners to amplify emission reduction efforts.  

## Compliance

- Comply with all relevant environmental laws, regulations, and industry standards.  
- Breaches of this policy may result in disciplinary or corrective action.

**Please read all these Terms and Conditions.**

**Green Orbit Digital**

At **Green Orbit Digital**, we aim to provide flexible, high-quality support to help businesses meet their marketing and sustainability goals. Our **Flexi Support Packages** are designed to offer adaptable, pre-paid hours for a variety of tasks. This **Fair Use Policy** is in place to ensure that our support services are used in a way that is consistent with the intent of the packages, promotes fairness, and ensures the highest level of service for all clients.

By purchasing a **Flexi Support Package**, you agree to the following terms and conditions regarding its use:

**1. Package Usage**

- **Ad Hoc & Emergency Support**:

    The **4 Hours Ad Hoc & Emergency Support** package is designed for urgent or one-time requests that require immediate attention within the same week. The hours should be used for tasks that fall under short-term, critical support needs. The hours are non-transferable and must be used within the same week of purchase.

- **Pre-Paid Support**:

    The **10, 25, and 50 Hours Pre-Paid Support** packages are intended for ongoing, non-emergency support over a defined period (30 days for the 10-hour package, 3 months for the 25-hour package, and 6 months for the 50-hour package). These packages are designed to offer flexibility and allow clients to plan for longer-term support needs, such as project management, campaign execution, or strategic consultations.

**2. Usage Periods**

- **Expiration**:

    Hours in the **Flexi Support Packages** must be used within the allotted timeframes. Unused hours will **expire** at the end of the respective time period (within 1 month for 10 hours, 3 months for 25 hours, and 6 months for 50 hours). No extensions will be provided, and unused hours cannot be rolled over into the next period.

- **Time Extensions**:

    If additional support is required beyond the hours purchased, clients will need to purchase additional hours at the applicable rate.

**3. Fair Usage Guidelines**

- **Scope of Tasks**:

    Hours are allocated for marketing and sustainability-related tasks as defined in the package description. These include project planning, campaign management, content creation, and consultancy services. They do not cover unrelated services such as large-scale creative work that requires significant additional resources (e.g., extensive custom graphic design or web development).

- **Excessive Usage**:

    The **Flexi Support Packages** are designed for normal business use and should not be used for excessive or unusual demand that exceeds the intended scope of the package. If it is found that a client consistently uses an excessive amount of hours in a short period, or for a single project that would otherwise require a different package or custom agreement, we may recommend an alternative arrangement or package.

- **Time Tracking**:

    **Green Orbit Digital** reserves the right to track and monitor the usage of hours in the support packages. We will notify you if we identify any patterns of usage that may fall outside the scope of the intended use. We aim to maintain transparency and avoid any misunderstandings regarding the hours spent on your projects.

**4. Additional Support Requests**

- **Additional Hours**:

    If your project requires additional hours beyond your **Flexi Support Package**, we will provide an invoice for additional hours at the prevailing hourly rate. This will be communicated to you in advance for approval before any extra work is undertaken.

- **Out-of-Scope Services**:

    Any work or tasks that fall outside of the scope of the package will be subject to separate agreements and billing. This includes services that require resources beyond the normal scope of support, such as large-scale development or design tasks that are not covered by the package.

**5. Fairness and Transparency**

- **Communication**:

    We are committed to open communication with clients regarding support package usage. If you are approaching the limit of your package or have questions about how to best use your remaining hours, please reach out to us. We will provide guidance on the best approach to maximise your support package effectively.

- **Refunds**:

    As the **Flexi Support Packages** are pre-paid, no refunds will be issued for unused hours. However, we will make every effort to ensure that the support we provide aligns with your needs and is used within the defined timeframes.

**6. Changes to the Fair Use Policy**

**Green Orbit Digital** reserves the right to amend or update this **Fair Use Policy** at any time. Clients will be notified of any significant changes. Continued use of the **Flexi Support Packages** after such changes signifies acceptance of the updated terms.

**7. Contact Us**

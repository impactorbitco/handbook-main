title: "Returns Policy"

**Please note you will need to remove/amend all highlighted text in this document.**

This policy is only appropriate for use with regard to customers who are “Consumers”. A “Consumer” means an individual acting for purposes that are wholly or mainly outside that individual’s trade, business, craft or profession.

A Consumer has certain statutory rights to return goods when the purchase took place via a “distance” or “off-premises” (generally at the Consumer’s property).  These rights apply even when there is absolutely nothing wrong with the goods in question.  The trader in these circumstances needs to comply with certain rules and procedures which are set out in our factsheet **BUSINESS TO CONSUMER – DISTANCE AND DOORSTEP SELLING**, and which are referred to at relevant points in this document.

**With regard to more traditional face-to-face purchase, such as those made within a shop, the trader does not legally need to have a return policy nor to accept goods back if there is nothing “wrong” with them.**  **As such having a policy such as this is entirely optional.**

Anyone wishing to have a policy such as this is going above and beyond what they are obliged to do.  However certain traders may take the view that it is good customer care and better for business in general to offer refunds so long as goods are returned in “mint” condition, within a certain period, and with proof of postage.  This precedent envisages just that scenario.

It must always be noted that the Consumer does, in addition anything set out in this policy, have statutory rights to expect that goods are, amongst other things:

- Of satisfactory quality.
- Fit for purpose.
- In accordance with their description.

In such case the Consumer has certain rights and the trader certain obligations.  See out factsheet **BUSINESS TO CONSUMER – SALE OF GOODS LAW** for further details

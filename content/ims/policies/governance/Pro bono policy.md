# **Introduction**

At Impact Orbit Creative Group, we believe in the transformative power of pro bono work to create positive impacts on our community and environment. This policy outlines our commitment to providing sustainable marketing services to charities aligned with our values and mission.

# **Defining Pro Bono Sustainable Marketing Services**

Pro bono sustainable marketing services involve the donation of our professional skills and expertise to not-for-profit organisations. We measure this contribution in hours spent providing marketing services that benefit the community, focusing on sustainability and environmental causes.

# **Criteria for Pro Bono Partnerships**

To ensure alignment with Impact Orbit Creative Group's values, we consider the following criteria for pro bono partnerships:

1. **Shared Values:** Both our agency and the not-for-profit organisation must share a passion for the cause and have aligned organisational values.
2. **Relevance:** The nature of the work needed, the community served, and the geographic location should align with our expertise and commitment to sustainability.
3. **Skill Set:** The team assigned to deliver pro bono work should possess the right skill set for the specific project.
4. **Mutual Respect:** A sense of mutual respect is crucial for the success of the partnership, fostering collaboration and effective communication.

**Principles of Partnership Agreement**

A well-defined Partnership Agreement is established at the outset of each pro bono collaboration. This agreement includes:

1. **Goals and Focus:** Clearly outlining the goals and focus of the partnership, ensuring both parties are aligned on the intended impact.
2. **Success Criteria:** Defining what success looks like for all involved, incorporating both qualitative and quantitative measures.
3. **Immersive Engagement:** Planning how both teams will immerse themselves in the purpose of the work, fostering a deep understanding of the cause.
4. **Communication:** Identifying specific points of contact for both the agency and the not-for-profit organisation, responsible for regular check-ins and oversight.
5. **Resource Commitment:** Determining the team members involved, estimating the hours committed per month, and establishing the duration of the pro bono commitment.
6. **Communication Plans:** Detailing how the partnership and its outcomes will be communicated to internal and external stakeholders, ensuring transparency.
7. **End of Commitment Plan:** Discussing and agreeing on an exit plan at the end of the commitment period, including any potential extensions and considerations for legacy.
8. **Legal and Compliance Documentation:** Identifying and addressing any legal and compliance documentation required to support the partnership, such as confidentiality agreements, professional indemnity, intellectual property, and data protection.

# **Green Orbit Digital Ethical Screening Policy**

POL/ETH/2025/1472-V1.1

# **Mission Alignment**

At **Green Orbit Digital**, our mission is to propel sustainable marketing in the space industry while minimising harm to people and the planet. Every project we take on is a launch opportunity—a chance to support ventures that align with our vision of a greener space sector. To ensure we stay on course, we apply a rigorous ethical screening process to all potential clients and projects, categorising them as **GO** for launch, **NO-GO** for ethical concerns, or requiring further **HOLD** status review.

# **Ethical Screening Flight Plan**

**Step 1 – Initial Mission Assessment**

All incoming leads are assigned to a **Mission Control (Business Development) specialist** for initial evaluation.

**Step 2 – NO-GO Screening**

If a project or client is **primarily engaged in or financially dependent** on any of the following, it is immediately classified as **NO-GO**, and the mission is scrubbed.

**Prohibited NO-GO Criteria:**

🚀 **Fossil Fuel Reliance:** Extraction, refinement, or heavy lobbying for oil, gas, or coal industries.

🛰 **Weapons & Conflict:** Arms manufacturing, military offensive systems, or organisations linked to war profiteering.

🌍 **Environmental Destruction:** Projects contributing significantly to deforestation, ocean degradation, or harmful extractive industries.

🐾 **Animal Exploitation:** Commercial animal agriculture, animal testing, or industries profiting from unethical wildlife trade.

🎰 **Predatory Practices:** Gambling, payday lending, or exploitative financial services.

📢 **Disinformation & Extremism:** Clients engaged in spreading hate speech, misinformation, or operating in an undemocratic manner.

🚭 **Harmful Consumer Goods:** Tobacco, unhealthy products marketed at children, or substances proven to cause significant harm.

If a lead falls into any of these categories, the **countdown is aborted** immediately.

**Step 3 – HOLD Screening**

If a lead clears the NO-GO criteria, it moves to the **HOLD** stage for further evaluation. The Mission Control team will analyse the project based on:

🔍 **Mixed Signals:** Does the client engage in both positive and questionable activities?

🌑 **Lack of Impact:** Does the project fail to contribute meaningfully to people or planet?

🌐 **Ties to NO-GO Industries:** Are there ownership, funding, or lobbying links to industries we prohibit?

📜 **Past Ethics Violations:** Has the organisation been accused of environmental, labour, or social injustices?

🏛 **Political & Ethical Ambiguity:** Does the project involve politically sensitive or ethically grey areas?

🤝 **Cultural Fit:** Does the organisation’s approach align with our values, or does something feel off?

🚦 **Gut Check:** Does the project feel ethically questionable upon deeper review?

If any of these factors raise concerns, the case is escalated to the **Mission Review Board (Senior Leadership Team)** for a go/no-go decision.

**Step 4 – Mission Review Board (SLT Decision)**

The **Mission Review Board** will conduct a final **go/no-go poll** based on the HOLD criteria.

🟢 **GO:** If no ethical concerns remain, the project is cleared for takeoff.

🔴 **NO-GO:** If concerns outweigh positive impact, the project is declined.

🟡 **HOLD:** If additional information is needed, further due diligence is conducted before a final decision.

In the event of a **split decision**, the **CEO or a designated officer** will cast the deciding vote.

**Step 5 – Proceed or Abort**

If a project receives a **GO for launch**, it moves into onboarding. If classified as **NO-GO**, the lead is formally declined with a transparent and respectful response.

To maintain mission integrity, all decisions are logged for future reference in our **CRM mission logs**.

# **Continuous Course Correction**

As in spaceflight, conditions evolve. We **periodically recalibrate** our ethical policy to stay aligned with industry best practices and global sustainability standards. Team members and clients are encouraged to provide input for ongoing improvements.

Green Orbit Digital’s **ethical trajectory is clear**: We support missions that contribute positively to the planet, space industry, and society while avoiding ventures that contradict our values.

🌍 **A more sustainable space sector begins with responsible choices.**

## 1. Purpose and Scope

This policy defines the principles and standards for ethical partnerships and sponsorships. It applies to all employees, contractors, suppliers, partners, and stakeholders involved in Impact Orbit’s operations. The aim is to ensure all sponsorship and partnership activities:

- Align with the company’s core values of integrity, sustainability, and social responsibility.
- Avoid association with unethical practices or organizations that contradict our mission.
- Promote transparency, inclusivity, and positive societal impact.

## 2. Ethical Considerations

Impact Orbit evaluates all partnerships and sponsorships to ensure alignment with our values:

- **Sustainability and Scientific Integrity:** We do not engage with organizations or individuals that oppose sustainable practices, undermine scientific consensus, or promote misinformation. Exceptions may occur only if the partnership enables meaningful, public dialogue on sustainability or science.  
- **Diversity and Inclusion:** We seek partnerships that foster inclusivity, equality, and respect for diversity while avoiding associations that promote discrimination or harmful stereotypes.  
- **International Engagement:** We adhere to UK government guidance and will not engage with individuals or organizations subject to sanctions or legal restrictions.

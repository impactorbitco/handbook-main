## Introduction

At **Impact Orbit Creative Group**, we are committed to preventing modern slavery, forced labour, and human trafficking in all its forms. Ethical conduct, transparency, and integrity underpin our operations and our relationships across the value chain.

We recognise our responsibilities under the **UK Modern Slavery Act 2015** and are committed to maintaining effective systems and controls to ensure modern slavery does not occur within our business or supply chains.

## Our Policies

Our approach is supported by a suite of internal policies, available to all staff via the company handbook, including:

- Ethics Policy  
- Whistleblowing Policy  
- Anti-Bullying and Harassment Policy  
- Equality, Diversity, and Inclusion Policy  
- Anti-Money Laundering Policy  
- Anti-Fraud, Bribery, and Gifts Policy  
- Safeguarding Policy  
- Safer Recruitment Policy  

These policies set clear expectations for behaviour, accountability, and the reporting of concerns.

- Code of Ethics  
- Anti-Slavery and Human Trafficking Policy

All suppliers and partners are expected to comply with applicable employment laws and human rights standards.

## Due Diligence Processes

We have implemented due diligence processes to identify, assess, and mitigate the risk of modern slavery, including:

- Risk-based supplier onboarding and assessment  
- Contractual obligations requiring compliance with modern slavery legislation  
- Ongoing monitoring of supplier relationships  
- Secure reporting channels with whistleblower protections  

Where risks are identified, appropriate corrective action is taken.

## Supplier Adherence

Suppliers are required to align with our zero-tolerance stance. Contracts explicitly prohibit:

- Forced, bonded, or compulsory labour  
- Human trafficking  
- Retention of identity documents  
- Unlawful recruitment fees  

Non-compliance may result in termination of the supplier relationship.

Relevant employees—particularly those involved in recruitment, procurement, and supplier management—receive training to:

- Understand modern slavery risks  
- Recognise potential indicators  
- Know how and where to raise concerns

## Measuring Effectiveness

Effectiveness is monitored through internal reporting and complaint tracking mechanisms. To date, no substantiated complaints relating to modern slavery or human trafficking have been reported.

## Next Steps and Continuous Improvement

We are committed to strengthening our approach through:

- Ongoing review of procurement strategies and supplier contracts  
- Reinforcing a zero-tolerance culture across the organisation

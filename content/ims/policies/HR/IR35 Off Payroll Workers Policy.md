**1. Introduction**

This policy outlines Green Orbit Digital's approach to compliance with the Off-Payroll Working Rules, commonly known as IR35, as set out by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC). The purpose of this policy is to ensure that all engagements with off-payroll workers are assessed and managed in accordance with IR35 legislation and any associated guidance.

**2. Scope**

This policy applies to all individuals engaged by Green Orbit Digital who provide their services through an intermediary, such as a personal service company (PSC), and are therefore potentially subject to the Off-Payroll Working Rules (IR35).

**3. Compliance Responsibilities**

- **Green Orbit Digital:** It is the responsibility of Green Orbit Digital to assess the employment status of off-payroll workers and determine whether IR35 applies to their engagement. This assessment will be conducted using reasonable care and in accordance with HMRC guidelines.
- **Managers and Hiring Teams:** Managers and hiring teams responsible for engaging off-payroll workers must work closely with the HR and Finance departments to ensure that all engagements comply with IR35 legislation. They must provide all necessary information to facilitate the status determination process.
- **HR Department:** The HR department is responsible for overseeing the status determination process, ensuring that all relevant information is obtained, and ensuring that determinations are made in a timely and accurate manner.

**4. Status Determination Process**

- **Initial Assessment:** When considering engaging an off-payroll worker, the hiring manager must provide the HR department with a detailed description of the role and the services to be provided. The HR department will then conduct an initial assessment to determine whether the engagement falls within the scope of IR35.
- **Status Determination Statement (SDS):** Based on the initial assessment, the HR department will issue a Status Determination Statement (SDS) to the hiring manager, clearly stating whether IR35 applies to the engagement and the reasons for this determination.
- **Appeals Process:** Off-payroll workers who disagree with the SDS issued by Green Orbit Digital have the right to appeal. The appeals process will be managed by the HR department, and the decision of the appeal panel will be final.

**5. Implementation**

- **Compliance Monitoring:** The HR department will monitor all engagements with off-payroll workers to ensure ongoing compliance with IR35 legislation. Any changes to working arrangements or roles that may affect IR35 status will be assessed promptly.
- **Training and Awareness:** Green Orbit Digital will provide training and guidance to managers, hiring teams, and off-payroll workers to raise awareness of IR35 legislation and their responsibilities under this policy.

**6. Record-Keeping**

- **Documentation:** Green Orbit Digital will maintain accurate records of all status determinations, appeals, and associated documentation in accordance with legal requirements.

**7. Review and Update**

- **Regular Review:** This policy will be reviewed regularly to ensure that it remains up-to-date with any changes in legislation or guidance related to IR35.

**8. Compliance Reporting**

- **Reporting Breaches:** Any breaches of this policy or instances of non-compliance with IR35 legislation must be reported to the HR department immediately for investigation and remediation.

**9. Confidentiality**

- **Confidentiality of Determinations:** All status determinations and associated information will be treated as confidential and disclosed only on a need-to-know basis.

**10. Contact Information**

- **Queries:** For any queries related to this policy or IR35 compliance, please contact the HR department.

This policy is effective as of [insert date] and applies to all engagements with off-payroll workers from this date onwards.

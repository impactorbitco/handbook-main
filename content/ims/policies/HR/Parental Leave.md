# **Maternity, Paternity, Adoption, and Parental Leave Policy**

| **Doc. ID** | POL/HR/2025/875-V1.1 | **Date of Last Revision** | 5 December 2024 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Effective Date** |  | **Version Number** | 1.0 |

Implemented November 2024  | Version 2.0

**a. Maternity Policy**

**Statement and Purpose of Policy**

1. Green Orbit Digital (the **Employer**, **we**, **our** or **us**) recognises and respects the rights of expectant and recent mothers to take time away from work in connection with their maternity and childbirth. No one will be subjected to a detriment for exercising their right to take maternity leave in accordance with this policy or for seeking to do so.
2. The purpose of this policy is to ensure that staff and managers are clear about entitlements to maternity leave, the process that should be followed for arranging leave and the terms that apply during and after maternity leave.
3. This policy is intended to summarise your statutory rights except for the paragraphs dealing with the Employer's enhanced maternity pay policy. If there is a contradiction between any other section of this policy and the statutory maternity leave entitlements that apply at any time, this policy shall be deemed to be amended, as necessary, to comply with legislative requirements.
4. This is a statement of policy only and does not form part of your contract of employment. We may amend this policy at any time, at our absolute discretion.

**Definitions**

1. In this policy we will use the following definitions:
    1. **Expected Week of Childbirth**: the week, starting on a Sunday, in which your doctor or midwife expects you to give birth.
    2. **Qualifying Week**: the 15th week before the Expected Week of Childbirth.

**What is Maternity Leave and Who is Eligible to Take it?**

1. Maternity leave is the right for qualifying employees to take up to 52 weeks of leave in connection with their pregnancy and/or birth of their child. Pregnant employees also have the right to time off work for antenatal appointments.
2. To be eligible for maternity leave you must:
    1. be an employee (not a contractor or consultant);
    2. be pregnant at the Qualifying Week; and
    3. in general, comply with the notification requirements set out in this policy.
3. The right to take maternity leave is not dependent on your length of service, although to qualify for statutory maternity pay, you must have at least 26 weeks of service at the Qualifying Week.
4. You may be eligible to take shared parental leave instead of your full entitlement of maternity leave. For details about shared parental leave, see the Employer’s Shared Parental Leave Policy available from your line manager or the HR Department.

**Giving Notice of Your Pregnancy**

1. In all cases, we request that you tell us as soon as possible that you are pregnant so that we can ensure we comply with any health and safety requirements.
2. You must tell us before the end of the Qualifying Week, or as soon as reasonably practical afterwards, that you are pregnant, the dates of your Expected Week of Childbirth and when you would like your maternity leave to start.
3. You must also confirm your Expected Week of Childbirth by providing us with a certificate from a doctor or midwife (this will usually be on a MAT B1 form).

**Antenatal Appointments**

1. During pregnancy, you may take time off from work to attend antenatal classes. You will be paid as normal. Please give us as much notice as you can of your intention to take time off. If you haven't already given us a certificate of your pregnancy from your midwife, doctor or health visitor then we will ask you to provide this and an appointment card for the class, except for the first appointment.

**Health and Safety During Your Pregnancy**

1. As well as our normal health and safety duties to all our staff, we will assess workplace risks specific to pregnant women and those who have recently become mothers and/or are breastfeeding. When you tell us that you are pregnant, we will inform you of any relevant risks that we have identified along with the measures that you and we must take to help protect against those risks. In some cases, we may need to take steps to protect you and/or your child against health hazards that may include having to:
    1. change your working arrangements;
    2. offer you suitable alternative work, on terms and conditions that are the same or not substantially less favourable; or
    3. suspend you from duties on full pay (or if you have unreasonably refused suitable alternative work, without pay).

**Sickness**

1. If you are absent from work because of pregnancy-related sickness then your entitlement to payment will be as for any other period of sickness absence and subject to the same limits and conditions, as set out in the Sickness Policy contained within this Staff Handbook. Payment in excess of the normal rules is at our discretion.
2. Pregnancy-related sickness absence will not be taken into account for the purpose of any employment decisions to which sickness absence is relevant.
3. During the 4 weeks immediately before your Expected Week of Childbirth, any sickness absence will normally automatically trigger the start of your maternity leave.

**Starting Maternity Leave**

1. As noted above, you must formally notify us of the date on which you want to start maternity leave before the end of the Qualifying Week.
2. Your maternity leave cannot start earlier than 11 weeks before the Expected Week of Childbirth (unless you give birth prematurely before then). Within 28 days of receiving your notice, we will confirm to you in writing the last date by which you must return from maternity leave.
3. You can change the start date for your maternity leave by giving us written notice. You must give the notice at least 28 days before the earlier of (i) the new start date or (ii) the original start date. If it is not possible to give that much notice then you must notify us as soon as reasonably practicable.
4. Your maternity leave will start on the date notified to us in accordance with this policy unless:
    1. you give birth before then, in which case your leave will start on the day after the birth and you must give us written notice of the date of birth as soon as possible; or
    2. you are absent from work for a pregnancy-related reason during the 4 weeks immediately before the Expected Week of Childbirth, in which case you must tell us as soon as possible in writing and leave will start on the day following the first day of that absence unless we agree otherwise.
5. You may not work during the 2 weeks immediately after giving birth, by law, so your maternity leave period must include these 2 weeks (or 4 weeks if you are a factory worker).
6. Near the time when your leave is due to start, we will discuss the arrangements for your maternity cover and the arrangements for keeping in touch with us during your leave, if you wish to do so. During your leave, you will continue to receive certain internal communications like job vacancies, social events, training and similar news unless you tell us that you would prefer not to receive these.

**Maternity Pay**

1. During your maternity leave, qualifying employees will be entitled to receive statutory maternity pay (SMP) for up to 39 weeks. To qualify, you must:
    1. still be employed and have at last 26 weeks of continuous employment at the end of the Qualifying Week;provide us with a doctor's or midwife's certificate (MAT B1 form) confirming the date of your Expected Week of Childbirth;
    2. have average earnings during the 8 weeks ending with the Qualifying Week (the Relevant Period) of at least the lower earnings limit set by the Government; and
    3. notify us of your intention to take maternity leave at least 28 days in advance or, if that is not possible, give us as much notice as you can.
2. During the first 6 weeks of your maternity leave, SMP is paid at 90% of your average weekly earnings calculated over the Relevant Period. After that, for up to a further 33 weeks, it is paid at a statutory rate set annually by the Government.
3. If you are due a pay rise during your maternity leave then this will be deemed to have applied during the Relevant Period, which will have the effect of retrospectively increasing your entitlement to SMP for the first 6 weeks of your maternity leave. If you have already received your SMP for that 6 weeks then we will pay you the difference in a lump sum. Otherwise, we will pay your SMP through normal payroll, less tax, National Insurance and any other lawful deductions.
4. We also provide an enhanced entitlement to maternity pay to employees who have at least 12 months of service at the end of the Qualifying Week. We will top up payments during the full duration of your maternity leave so that you receive, inclusive of SMP, at least 90% of your normal basic pay over the same period. We will also pay you £500.00, provided that you remain employed and are not under notice of termination (whether served by you or us) for 4 weeks after your return to work following maternity leave.
5. SMP will stop being payable if you return to work (except where you are simply keeping in touch as described in the "During maternity leave" section below).
6. If you leave employment after the start of the Qualifying Week you will still be eligible for SMP from the later of (i) the week following your final week of employment or (ii) the 11th week before the Expected Week of Childbirth.

**During Maternity Leave**

1. While you are on maternity leave, your normal terms of employment will continue to apply except for your entitlement to pay. In particular, benefits in kind shall continue and you will continue to accrue holiday. The effect of your maternity leave on your pension arrangements depends on the type of scheme in which you are participating and the terms of your participation. For further information on this, speak to your line manager or the HR Department.
2. Although we will respect your absence during your maternity leave, we may need to make contact with you from time to time. In particular, we will make contact shortly before your maternity leave ends to arrange a discussion with you about your return to work including any training needs, proposed changes to your working arrangements or just to update you on developments in your absence. If you have any concerns regarding this, you should speak with your line manager or the HR Department.

**Keeping in Touch Days**

1. In addition to the circumstances described above, in respect of keeping in contact, employees may also attend work for training or other reasons during their maternity leave for up to 10 days by prior agreement with us, known as 'Keeping-in-Touch Days' or 'KIT Days'. You are under no obligation to do this. Attending work on this basis will not end your maternity leave or your entitlement to maternity pay.
2. A day for the purpose of KIT Days does not necessarily mean a full or standard work shift of normal duration but can be any length of time (e.g. a half-day or a partial day).
3. You will be paid at your normal basic rate of pay for time spent working on a KIT Day and this will be inclusive of any maternity pay entitlement.
4. We affirm that we will not force any employee to use any KIT Days. An employee may freely and without penalty turn down any request we may make for them to attend the workplace for a KIT Day. Similarly, we may also freely reject any request that an employee makes to use a KIT Day.
5. If you would like to discuss this option further, you should speak with your line manager or the HR Department.

**Expected Return Date**

1. As noted above, we will confirm to you the date on which you are expected to return to work after maternity leave within 28 days of your notifying your pregnancy and leave start date to us. If your maternity leave start date changes for any reason then we will confirm the revised return to work date to you within 28 days of the start of your maternity leave.
2. If you plan to come back to work on the return date that we have notified to you then you are not obliged to do anything further, although we would be grateful if you would help us plan ahead by confirming during your leave that you will return as expected.
3. If you wish to return to work earlier than the date that we have notified to you then you will need to give us at least 8 weeks' prior notice of the new date and we request that you do this in writing. If you don't give us 8 weeks' notice then we may postpone your return until the sooner of 8 weeks from the date of your notice or the date that you were originally expected to return.
4. If you wish to return later than the date we have notified to you then you should either:
    1. request parental leave, in accordance with the Employer’s Parental Leave Policy available from your line manager or the HR Department; or
    2. request to take holiday in accordance with your contract.
5. If sickness absence prevents you from returning on the planned date then the normal rules relating to sickness absence will apply.
6. In any other case, late return will be treated as unauthorised absence.
7. If you decide not to return to work at all then you must give notice of resignation in accordance with your contract of employment. If your maternity leave is due to end during the currency of your notice period then you may be required to return to work until your notice period expires.

**When You Return to Work**

1. In general, you will return to work in the same job and on the same terms as if you had not been absent. However, in some cases where you have taken more than 6 months' leave or any period of parental leave in conjunction with your maternity leave then we may offer you another suitable role, on terms and conditions that are not less favourable than those that applied before your leave.
2. If you wish to change your working patterns when you return to work then you should make a request for flexible working in line with set procedures that are set out in our Flexible Working Policy contained within this Staff Handbook. Flexible working requests take time to deal with so it's important that you make your request as soon as possible, otherwise, you may have to return to work on the basis of your prior working patterns until the process of dealing with the request has finished.

**Rights to Leave on Adoption**

1. Certain employees can take adoption leave, paternity leave or shared parental leave in relation to the adoption of a child. Further details are set out in our Adoption Leave Policy available from your line manager or the HR Department.

- The earliest that the Maternity Leave can start is 11 weeks before the expected week of childbirth.
    - If the baby is early, maternity leave will start the day after childbirth
    - Maternity leave will begin automatically if the team member is off work for a pregnancy-related illness in the 4 weeks before the expected week of childbirth.
- Team members are not required to take the full 52 weeks of maternity leave, but **must** take at least 2 weeks of leave after the baby is born. Team members should give at least eight weeks’ notice if they would like to change their return to work date.

**Statutory Paternity Leave:** Team members can take up to 2 weeks of Paternity Leave or up to 50 weeks of [Shared Parental Leave](https://www.gov.uk/shared-parental-leave-and-pay). Paternity Leave *cannot* be taken after Shared Parental Leave.

- Eligibility: You must be taking time off to look after the child and be one of the following:
    - the father
    - the husband or partner of the mother (or adopter) - this includes same-sex partners
    - the child’s adopter
    - the intended parent (if you’re having a baby through a surrogacy arrangement)
- There are extra conditions you need to meet to qualify for leave and pay.

**Statutory Adoption Leave:** Team members can take up to 52 weeks of Adoption Leave.

### **Statutory Neonatal Care Leave and Pay (SNCL&P)**

New right to neonatal care leave and pay beginning April 6, 2025.

**Neonatal Care Leave (NCL)** will apply to parents of babies who are admitted into neonatal care up to 28 days old and who have a continuous stay in hospital of 7 full days or longer. These measures will allow eligible parents to take up to 12 weeks of leave (and, if eligible, pay) on top of any other leave they may be entitled to, including maternity and paternity leave. The leave must be taken within 68 weeks of your baby’s birth. Neonatal Care Leave is a day-one right.

There are two tiers of Neonatal Care Leave: **Tier 1:** Available when the child is in neo-natal care, and the first week after their release. The leave must be taken in 7 continuous day blocks. Overlap with a pre-booked parental leave, the SNCL can be paused to allow the other parental leave to be taken. Team members must provide notice to their employer as soon as reasonably practicable.

**Tier 2:** Available from the second week following their release, up to 68 weeks following the child’s birth. Taken as a single block, as this leave is taken when the child is out of neo-natal care and can be planned. Team members wanting to take one week SNCL&P will need to give two weeks and one days’ notice in advance.

**Neonatal Care Pay (NCP)** is available to eligible employed parents who will be able to claim up to 12 weeks of NCP. To be eligible, team members must:

- Have at least 26 weeks of continuous service with their employer and,
- Meet the minimum earnings threshold (Your average gross weekly earnings must be at least equal to the lower earnings limit, for April 2024-25, this is £123 per week.)

Eligible team members will receive the lower of:

- Standard rate £187.18
- Or 90% of their average weekly earnings

[GitLab’s Parental Leave](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/total-rewards/benefits/general-and-entity-benefits/#parental-leave) policy will run concurrently with NCL and NCP topping up the statutory pay to 100% regular salary.

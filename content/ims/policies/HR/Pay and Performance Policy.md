### Introduction

At Green Orbit Digital, we recognize that fair compensation and performance management are essential components of our organizational success. This policy outlines our approach to pay and performance issues, including how we determine compensation, evaluate employee performance, and address any related concerns.

### Compensation Philosophy

Our compensation philosophy is based on the principles of fairness, competitiveness, and recognition of individual contributions. We strive to provide competitive salaries and benefits that attract and retain top talent while ensuring internal equity and market alignment. Our goal is to reward performance, skills, and experience in a transparent and consistent manner.

### Determination of Compensation

Compensation decisions at Green Orbit Digital are based on multiple factors, including:

1. **Market Data:** We regularly conduct market research to benchmark our salaries and benefits against industry standards and local market conditions.
2. **Job Evaluation:** We use job evaluation techniques to assess the relative value of different roles within the organisation and establish appropriate salary ranges.
3. **Performance:** Employee performance and contributions to the organisation are considered when determining compensation adjustments, promotions, and bonuses.
4. **Experience and Skills:** Individual qualifications, skills, experience, and potential for growth are taken into account when setting salary levels.

### Performance Management

We believe in continuous feedback and performance development to help employees succeed and grow within the organisation. Our performance management process includes:

1. **Goal Setting:** Employees and their managers collaboratively set SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) goals aligned with organisational objectives.
2. **Regular Check-ins:** Managers conduct regular check-ins with their team members to provide feedback, review progress, and address any performance-related issues.
3. **Performance Reviews:** Formal performance reviews are conducted on an annual basis, providing an opportunity for a comprehensive assessment of individual performance, accomplishments, and areas for improvement.
4. **Recognition and Rewards:** High performers are recognised and rewarded through merit-based salary increases, bonuses, promotions, and other forms of recognition.

### Addressing Performance Issues

In cases where performance issues arise, we are committed to providing support and guidance to help employees improve. Our approach to addressing performance issues includes:

1. **Identification:** Managers identify performance concerns through regular feedback, performance reviews, and other relevant channels.
2. **Support and Coaching:** Managers work closely with employees to understand the root causes of performance issues and provide necessary support, coaching, and resources for improvement.
3. **Performance Improvement Plans (PIPs):** If performance concerns persist, managers may develop formal Performance Improvement Plans (PIPs) outlining specific goals, timelines, and expectations for improvement.
4. **Progress Monitoring:** Managers monitor the progress of employees on PIPs and provide ongoing feedback and support to facilitate improvement.
5. **Decision Making:** In cases where performance issues persist despite intervention efforts, managers may need to make decisions regarding disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment, in accordance with company policies and applicable laws.

### Conclusion

At Green Orbit Digital, we are committed to fostering a culture of performance excellence, fairness, and transparency in all aspects of pay and performance management. By aligning compensation with individual contributions and providing ongoing support for performance development, we aim to maximize employee engagement, satisfaction, and organizational success.

**1. Introduction:**
At Green Orbit Digital, we uphold the highest standards of ethics and integrity in all aspects of our operations. We recognize that whistleblowing plays a crucial role in identifying and addressing wrongdoing or unethical behavior within the company. This policy is designed to encourage employees and others associated with Green Orbit Digital to confidentially report concerns about illegal or severely unethical conduct.

**2. Objectives of the Policy:**
The objectives of this policy are to:

- Encourage the reporting of concerns about wrongdoing or malpractice within Green Orbit Digital.
- Provide avenues for reporting concerns and ensure that whistleblowers are protected from victimization or retaliation.

- Criminal activities
- Health and safety hazards
- Financial misconduct

- Whistleblowers may report concerns via email, telephone, or in person.
- Whistleblowers should provide detailed information about the nature of their concerns, including relevant background information and any evidence available.

**6. Handling of Concerns:**

- Upon receiving a concern, Green Orbit Digital will conduct an initial assessment to determine the appropriate course of action.
- Investigations will be carried out promptly and impartially by management or designated personnel.
- Whistleblowers will be kept informed of the progress and outcome of the investigation to the extent possible, while maintaining confidentiality.

- Records of concerns, investigations, and outcomes will be maintained confidentially and securely by Green Orbit Digital.

**8. Taking Matters Further:**

- If whistleblowers are not satisfied with the outcome of the investigation, they may choose to escalate the matter externally to the police, trade union representatives, or legal authorities.
- This policy does not prevent whistleblowers from seeking their own legal advice if necessary.

**9. Record Keeping:**

- Green Orbit Digital will document and keep records of all concerns raised, investigations conducted, and outcomes reached.
- These records will be stored confidentially and will only be accessed when required for investigative or compliance purposes.

# **WHISTLEBLOWING POLICY**

| **Doc. ID** | POL/ETH/2025/829-V1.1 | **Date of Last Revision** | 5 December 2024 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Effective Date** |  | **Version Number** | 1.0 |

# **1. Policy Statement**

Green Orbit Digital promotes a culture of openness and transparency in its interactions with managers, employees, and all stakeholders involved in its business and training activities. The organization recognizes the importance of effective and honest communication to address concerns about breaches or failures and ensure overall success.

This policy is designed to provide guidance to all those who work with or within the organisation who may from time to time feel that they need to raise certain issues relating to the organisation with someone in confidence.

Workers who in the public interest raise genuine concerns under this policy will not under any circumstances be subjected to any form of detriment or disadvantage as a result of having raised their concerns.

1.1 Objective:

This policy aims to empower and encourage staff to report concerns within Green Orbit Digital. It acknowledges workers' legal rights to make protected disclosures under relevant legislation, fostering a safe and transparent workplace culture.

1.2 Commitment to Prevention:

Green Orbit Digital is committed to preventing and addressing fraud, misconduct, and wrongdoing by promptly investigating and addressing reported concerns. Internal mechanisms are in place for reporting malpractice or illegal activities, with a commitment to consistent and fair treatment of all disclosures.

1.3 Training and Induction:

Regular refresher training is provided to all managers, ensuring they are equipped to handle raised concerns. New employees, supervisors, and managers undergo induction on the whistleblowing policy, emphasizing awareness of whistleblowing laws and the proper use of the policy.

1.4 Resources and Accessibility:

Adequate resources are allocated to support the policy's aims, and it is widely promoted. Copies are accessible in Green Orbit Digital's offices and through the staff intranet, ensuring widespread awareness.

1.5 Protection from Retaliation:

This policy assures staff protection from harassment or victimization for raising concerns. In case of dissatisfaction with the management response, staff are encouraged to escalate the matter further.

2. Definitions and Scope:

This policy applies to all staff, including temporary, casual, and agency staff, as well as volunteers, self-employed individuals, and contractors. Whistleblowing, as recognized by Green Orbit Digital, involves passing on information about wrongdoing at work when the whistleblower reasonably believes they are acting in the public interest.

2.1 Categories of Wrongdoing:

Examples of wrongdoing include criminal offenses, breaches of legal obligations, miscarriages of justice, endangering health and safety, environmental damage, and deliberate concealment of information related to these issues.

2.2 Protection and Confidentiality:

Staff making protected disclosures have the right to protection from dismissal, detriment, or victimisation. Confidentiality is maintained throughout the process, and any confidentiality clauses in settlement agreements do not prevent disclosures in the public interest.

2.3 Reporting Other Concerns:

For concerns about employment that affect only the individual, the grievance or dignity at work policies are more appropriate.

2.4 Review and Consultation:

This policy is subject to annual review, with designated officers and the senior management team overseeing its effectiveness and relevance. Legislative changes prompt immediate review.

1. 
    1. This policy applies to all staff including temporary, casual and agency staff, work experience, trainees, apprentices and learners. Other individuals who work or have worked within the organisation, such as former staff, volunteers, the self-employed and contractors, are also encouraged to use it.
    2. For the purpose of this policy, Anicca Digital ****recognises that whistleblowing is the passing on of information about wrongdoing at work. The whistleblower must reasonably believe that they are acting in the public interest.
    3. The statutory categories for wrongdoing are:
2. a criminal offence (such as insurance fraud or illegal tax evasion)
3. a breach of any legal obligation
4. a miscarriage of justice
5. endangering an individual’s health and safety
6. damage to the environment
7. deliberate concealment of information about any of the above.
    1. Examples of wrongdoing might include (but are not restricted to) :
8. unsafe working conditions
9. lack of, or poor, response to a reported safety incident
10. inadequate induction or training for staff
11. suspicions of fraud
12. a bullying culture (across a team or organisation rather than individual instances of bullying).
13. Safeguarding Issues
    1. It is not necessary for the member of staff to have proof that wrongdoing is being, has been, or is likely to be committed. A reasonable belief is sufficient to disclose the concern. The member of staff has no responsibility for investigating the wrongdoing. It is the organisation's responsibility to ensure that an investigation takes place.
    2. A member of staff who makes such a protected disclosure has the right not to be dismissed, subjected to any other detriment, or victimised, because they have made a disclosure.
    3. Anicca Digital recognises that any so-called ‘gagging’ or confidentiality clauses in settlement agreements or non-disclosure agreements with individuals do not prevent members of staff from making disclosures in the public interest and are void in such circumstances.
    4. If the wrongdoing that the staff member wants to disclose is not included in the list above, advice may be sought from the designated officers (see section 4 below) or from a trade union representative on the use of the appropriate policy.
    5. This policy is not for staff with concerns about their employment that affect only them – that type of concern is better suited to the grievance policy or dignity at work policy which can be found at the office or on the Intranet.
    6. Anicca Digital recognises employees may wish to seek advice and be represented by their trade union(s) officers when using the provisions in this policy.
    7. This policy will be reviewed annually from date of issue by the designated officer/s (see section 4 below) in conjunction with the senior management team. Where review is necessary due to legislative change, this will happen immediately.

3. Roles and Responsibilities:

3.1 Senior Management and Board:

The senior management team and Board are accountable for the Whistleblowing Policy, demonstrating a commitment to an open culture. They receive annual reports on whistleblowing activity and appoint designated officers.

3.2 All Staff:

All staff have a duty to report wrongdoing under the circumstances outlined in the policy. This includes awareness of the policy, understanding of responsibilities, and reporting any concerns promptly.

3.3 Line Managers:

3.4 Designated Officers:

Designated officers oversee and review the policy, provide advice and support, ensure learning from cases is disseminated, train managers, investigate issues promptly, and report whistleblowing activity to the senior management team.

The senior management team **and Board** **are responsible and accountable for this Whistleblowing Policy and Procedure.  They will:

- demonstrate commitment to developing an open culture within the organisation, through actions and strategy
- receive and review annual reports on whistleblowing activity
- appoint designated officer/s.

3.2   All staff have a duty to report wrongdoing (whistleblow) under the circumstances set out in section 2 of this policy.

3.3Line managers are responsible for:

- ensuring all staff are aware of this policy and procedure and their responsibilities
- investigating issues raised promptly and thoroughly
- fostering an open culture within their teams

- provide reports on whistleblowing activity on an annual basis to the senior management team.

4. Designated Officers:

Darren Wynn and Angie Longman have been nominated and agreed upon as designated officers. They act as independent and impartial sources of advice to staff, ensuring confidentiality, timely support, and access to necessary resources.

1. 
    1. The following people have been nominated and agreed by Anicca Digital ****as designated officers for concerns under this procedure*:*

*Darren Wynn and Angie Longman*

1. 
    1. These designated officers will act as an independent and impartial source of advice to staff at any stage of raising a concern, with access to anyone in the organisation.
    2. These people have been given special responsibility and training in dealing with whistleblowing concerns and will give you information about where you can go for more support. They will:
2. treat the concern confidentially unless otherwise agreed
3. ensure the staff member receives timely support to progress their concern
4. escalate to senior management any indications that the staff member is being subjected to detriment for raising their concern
5. remind the organisation of the need to give the staff member timely feedback on how their concern is being dealt with
6. ensure the staff member has access to personal support as it is recognised that raising such a concern may be stressful.

5. How to Raise a Concern:

Staff are encouraged to raise concerns informally with their line manager or directly with designated officers. The policy provides guidance on raising concerns, seeking legal advice if necessary, and ensuring confidentiality.

5.1 Raising Concerns Anonymously:

While staff may disclose information anonymously, it is noted that anonymous whistleblowers may have limitations in receiving feedback or participating in the resolution process.

1. 
    1. In many circumstances, the easiest way a member of staff can get their concern resolved will be to raise it formally or informally with their line manager who should report it to the designated officer.
    2. If this is not appropriate as the concern relates to the line manager, or if the member of staff does not feel able to raise it with them or if raising it with their line manager does not resolve matters, the member of staff can approach a designated officer directly. The designated officer will then confirm how the matter will be investigated.
    3. Any member of staff who wants to raise a concern that is potentially of public interest, is encouraged to get legal advice where appropriate such as through their union or through the charity Protect (see section 9.’More information and support’ below). Staff can also refer to the companies HR support: [https://www.brighthr.com/](https://www.brighthr.com/)
    4. If, for any reason, the member of staff does not feel comfortable raising their concern internally, they can raise concerns externally with ‘prescribed bodies’ (see section 8 below) if they feel this is necessary and in the public interest.
    5. Concerns should be raised in writing (including email). The letter should set out the background and history of the concerns, giving names, dates and places where possible, and the reason why the member of staff is making the disclosure. If the individual does not feel able to make the disclosure in writing, an interview will be arranged.
    6. When any meetings are arranged with an individual who is making or has made a protected disclosure, they have a right to be accompanied by a trade union representative. The meeting can be off site if requested.
    7. The employee raising concerns does not have to prove the allegation but they must demonstrate that there are sufficient grounds for concern.
    8. If the member of staff wants to raise the matter in confidence, they should please say at the outset so that appropriate arrangements can be made.
    9. Confidentiality will be maintained as far as is possible. It is guaranteed at the point of making a protected disclosure and will be maintained throughout the investigation and hearings, other than when a disclosure of identity is needed due to cross examination of the staff member as a witness to any subsequent procedure, or is required by law.
    10. It is best to raise a concern openly, because that makes it easier for Anicca Digital to follow it up. Anicca Digital ****will not disclose the whistleblower’s identity without their consent unless there are legal reasons that require them to do so. This might be, for example, where their information is about a child or vulnerable adult who is at risk, or where there is a possible criminal offence. If this is the case, Anicca Digital may have to tell the police or another official body, or if required to do so by a court. Anicca Digital will let the individual know if it has to do this and that this will identify them to another body.
    11. Staff may, if they wish, disclose information anonymously. However, it should be noted that in such circumstances, Anicca Digital ****will not be able to contact staff to discuss their concern or ask them for further information, nor will they normally be able to give any feedback about any action it takes, although anonymous whistleblowers may seek feedback through a telephone appointment or by using an anonymised email address.

6. How Green Orbit Digital Will Respond:

Concerns raised under this policy are thoroughly, promptly, and confidentially investigated. The process involves acknowledging receipt, indicating how the matter will be handled, informing the staff of the investigation's progress, and providing timely feedback on outcomes.

6.1 Investigation and Data Protection:

Internal investigations are objective and evidence-based, processed in line with Green Orbit Digital's data protection policy. The investigation aims to identify and rectify issues, learning lessons to prevent recurrence.

6.2 Outcome Communication:

Upon conclusion of an investigation, the staff raising the concern is informed of the outcome and actions taken. Full investigation reports are shared where possible while respecting confidentiality.

1. 
    1. Any concern raised under this policy will be investigated thoroughly, promptly and confidentially.
    2. Any approach to line managers and designated officers will be treated with the strictest confidence and the member of staff’s identity will not be disclosed without their prior consent. All members of staff will be treated with respect at all times and the person raising the concern will be thanked.
    3. There may be a meeting with the member of staff raising the concern to ensure Anicca Digital understands exactly the particular worry.
    4. When any meetings are arranged with an employee who has made a protected disclosure, they have a right to be accompanied by a trade union representative. The meeting can be off site if requested.
    5. When an individual makes a disclosure, the organisation will process any personal data collected as part of the investigation in line with Anicca Digital’s data protection policy which can be found in Cinders ensuring the data is stored securely and only accessed by those individuals essential for dealing with the disclosure***.***
    6. Within five working days of a concern being raised, the line manager or designated officer who received the disclosure will write to the member of staff setting out the following:
2. Acknowledgement that the concern has been received, the date it has been received, whether the person who raised the concern has requested confidentiality, and a summary of the concern
3. Indicating how the matter will be dealt with and by whom and how they can be contacted
4. Telling the member of staff when an investigation has or is to be started and if further assistance will be needed from them.
    1. The member of staff who raises the concern will be told how long to expect the investigation to take and will be kept up to date with its progress.
    2. The matters raised may be investigated internally. Where it has not been possible to resolve the matter quickly (usually within a few days) with the line manager, someone suitably independent (such as a designated officer) and properly trained will carry out an investigation.
    3. The investigation will be objective and evidence-based, and will produce a report that focuses on identifying and rectifying any issues, and learning lessons to prevent problems recurring. The investigator may decide that the concern would be better looked at under another process, such as the grievance procedure or dignity at work procedure. If so, this will be discussed with the member of staff.
    4. In the event that misconduct is discovered as a result of any investigation under this policy, the disciplinary policy and procedure will be invoked in addition to any external measures.
    5. On conclusion of any investigation, the member of staff will be told the outcome of the investigation and what Anicca Digital has done, or proposes to do, about it. Wherever possible, Anicca Digital will share the full investigation report with the member of staff who raised the concern (while respecting the confidentiality of others). If no action is to be taken, the reason for this will be explained.
    6. If an individual is not satisfied with the response received and any subsequent action taken, they should put their concerns in writing to Ann Stanley, who will arrange any further investigation as she thinks appropriate. Ann Stanley will send a written response to the individual concerned.
    7. More serious disclosures may be referred to an external prescribed person or body and may form the subject of an independent inquiry.
    8. In the event of an inquiry, where possible the trade union representatives will be consulted on the drawing up of terms of reference for any inquiry panel, as well as being involved in the implementation of any inquiry recommendations.

7. Harassment and Victimisation:

Green Orbit Digital strictly prohibits harassment, victimization, or attempts to dissuade whistleblowers. Such behaviour is considered a serious breach of organizational values and may result in disciplinary action.

1. 
    1. Anicca Digital understands that raising a concern can be difficult for staff, especially if they fear reprisal from those responsible for the malpractice. Anicca Digital will not tolerate harassment and victimisation of anyone raising a concern, and there should be no impact on the continued employment and opportunities for future promotion or training of anyone raising a concern. Any such behaviour is a serious breach of our values as an organisation and, if upheld following investigation, could result in disciplinary action potentially leading to dismissal.
    2. Nor will Anicca Digital tolerate any attempt to bully anyone into not raising any such concern. Any such behaviour is a breach of our values as an organisation and, if upheld following investigation, could result in disciplinary action potentially leading to dismissal.

7.3 This policy encourages members of staff to put their name to their concerns.  Concerns expressed anonymously are harder to follow up and have an effective outcome.

7.4If a member of staff makes an allegation in good faith, but the allegation is not confirmed by the investigation, no action will be taken against that member of staff. They will not be at risk of losing their job or suffering any form of reprisal as a result. Provided the member of staff is acting honestly, it does not matter if they are mistaken or if there is an innocent explanation for their concerns.

8. Reporting to External Bodies:

While the policy encourages internal reporting, staff dissatisfied with outcomes or uncomfortable raising concerns internally may report externally to prescribed persons or bodies listed by the UK government.

This policy is intended to provide a route by which members of staff can raise concerns internally.  However, if an employee is unhappy with the outcome of an investigation or if, for any reason they do not feel comfortable raising their concern internally, they are free to take the matter outside of the organisation to a prescribed person or body or to their Member of Parliament (MP).

1. 
    1. The full list of prescribed persons and bodies can be found on the UK government website at [www.gov.uk/government/publications/blowing-the-whistle-list-of-prescribed-people-and-bodies--2/whistleblowing-list-of-prescribed-people-and-bodies](http://www.gov.uk/government/publications/blowing-the-whistle-list-of-prescribed-people-and-bodies--2/whistleblowing-list-of-prescribed-people-and-bodies). They include

The law provides protection for workers who raise legitimate concerns about specified matters (whistleblowers). These are called "qualifying disclosures". A qualifying disclosure is one made in the public interest, or preserving the charitable focus of the organisation, by a worker who has a reasonable belief that one or more of the following is, or has been, or is likely to be committed:

- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 

a criminal offence;

a miscarriage of justice;

an act creating risk to health and safety;

an act causing damage to the environment;

a breach of any other legal obligation;

concealment of any of the above;

It is not necessary for the worker to have proof that such an act is being, has been, or is likely to

be, committed - a reasonable belief is sufficient. The worker has no responsibility for

investigating the matter, it is the organisation's responsibility to ensure that an investigation

takes place.

A worker who makes such a legitimate protected disclosure has the right not to be dismissed,

subjected to any other detriment, or victimised, because they have made a disclosure.

The legislation protecting individuals who make a protected disclosure applies not only to

workers but also to any person who undertakes to do or perform personally (or otherwise) any

work or service for the employer, regardless of the nature of the contractual relationship

between them.

**WHISTLEBLOWING POLICY**

*Ref: FP01 v5*

*This document is uncontrolled if printed*

WRAP encourages workers to raise their concerns under this procedure in the first instance. If a

worker is not sure whether to raise a concern, they should discuss the issue with their line

manager or a member of the HR team.

This policy applies to all workers of WRAP. Other individuals performing functions in relation to WRAP, such as agency workers and contractors, are encouraged to use it.

It is important to WRAP that any fraud, misconduct or wrongdoing by workers of the

organisation is reported and properly dealt with. WRAP therefore encourages all individuals to

raise any concerns that they may have about the conduct of others in the business or the way in

which the business is run.

This policy sets out the way in which individuals may raise any concerns that they have and how

those concerns will be dealt with.

Any matter raised under this procedure will be investigated thoroughly, promptly and confidentially, and the outcome of the investigation reported back to the worker who raised the issue.

A worker who makes such a protected disclosure has the right not to be dismissed, subjected to

any other detriment, or victimised, because s/he has made a disclosure. This means that the

continued employment and opportunities for future promotion or training of the worker will not

be prejudiced because they have raised a legitimate concern. If a worker believes that s/he has

suffered any such treatment, s/he should inform the Commercial, Finance & Operations Director

(CFO) immediately. If the matter is not remedied, the worker should raise it formally using the

Grievance Procedure. Victimisation of a worker for raising a qualified disclosure will be a disciplinary offence and could

result in disciplinary action in accordance with the organisation’s disciplinary procedure.

“**Protect**” is a whistleblowing charity who provide confidential advice for individuals who have

witnessed wrongdoing in their workplace but are unsure how to raise their concerns. They

operate a confidential helpline 020 3117 2520 and advice can be found on their website: [www.protect-advice.org.uk](http://www.protect-advice.org.uk/) This policy is written in line with guidance from the Charity Commission, further information

*Ref: FP01 v5*

Stage 1. Any disclosure should be made to the CFO in the first instance. If the disclosure relates

to the CFO, then the disclosure should be made to the CEO. If the disclosure implicates the

CEO, the disclosure should be made to the Chair of the Audit and Risk Committee (contact

details at the end of the policy). The individual to whom the disclosure is made is designated as

the Investigation Sponsor.

Stage 2. The Investigation Sponsor will arrange an investigation into the matter (either by

investigating the matter personally or immediately passing the issue to an independent person

with the appropriate technical expertise to carry out an investigation). The investigation may

involve the worker and other individuals involved giving a written statement. Any investigation

*This document is uncontrolled if printed*

If a worker reports a disclosure to WRAP, the need for confidentiality will be respected although any concern raised under this procedure will need to be properly documented.

WRAP believes that all workers should feel able to put their name to the allegations which they

raise, as concerns expressed anonymously are more difficult to investigate. If workers raise a

concern anonymously, depending upon the exact circumstances, it may nonetheless be possible

for their identity to be deduced. If, contrary to this policy, they then suffer reprisals, it may be

difficult to show that this was as a result of them raising a concern, i.e. it may not be possible to

protect unidentified people.

If a worker reports his / her concern to the media, in most cases the worker will lose his / her

whistleblowing law rights.

**Procedure**

If misconduct is discovered as a result of any investigation under this procedure the organisation's disciplinary procedure will be used, in addition to any appropriate external measures.

If an allegation is made maliciously, for personal gain or is deemed to be vexatious, appropriate

action, that could include disciplinary action, may be taken.

An instruction to cover up wrongdoing is itself a disciplinary offence. If told not to raise or pursue

any concern, even by a person in authority such as a manager, workers should not agree to

remain silent. They should report the matter to a member of the HR team. This procedure is for disclosures about matters other than a breach of a worker's own contract

of employment. If a worker is concerned that their own contract has been, or is likely to be,

broken, they should use the organisation's grievance procedure.

will be carried out in accordance with the principles set out above. The worker's statement will

be considered, and they will be asked to comment on any additional evidence obtained.

The outcome of the investigation, including a recommendation as to whether the matter

requires reporting to the appropriate government department or regulatory agency (see further

details below), will be submitted to the CEO. All whistleblowing disclosures will also be reported

to the Audit and Risk Committee for information. If the whistleblowing disclosure concerns the

CEO then the report will go to the Audit and Risk Committee only. If disciplinary action is required, the Investigation Sponsor will report the matter to the HR team

and start the disciplinary procedure. On conclusion of any investigation, the worker will be told

the outcome of the investigation and the recommended course of action. If no action is to be

taken, the reason for this will be explained.

Stage 3. If the worker is concerned that WRAP has failed to make a proper investigation they

should inform the Investigation Officer who will arrange for another manager to review the

investigation carried out, make any necessary enquiries and make their own report to the CEO

and the Audit and Risk Committee as in stage 2 above. Any approach will be treated with the

strictest confidence and the worker's identity will not be disclosed without their prior consent. Stage 4. If on conclusion of stages 1, 2 and 3 the worker reasonably believes that the

appropriate action has not been taken, they can report the matter to the proper authority. The

legislation sets out a number of bodies to which qualifying disclosures may be made. These

include:

- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 

The Charity Commission;

HM Revenue & Customs;

the Financial Conduct Authority (formerly the Financial Services Authority);

the Competition and Markets Authority;

the Health and Safety Executive;

the Environment Agency;

the Serious Fraud Office.

When an individual makes a disclosure, WRAP will process any personal data collected in accordance with its data protection policy. Data collected from the point at which the individual makes the report is held securely and accessed by, and disclosed to, individuals only for the purposes of dealing with the disclosure.

The *General Data Protection Regulation* (GDPR) requires employers to comply with principles for

processing personal data, including protecting against unauthorised access of personal data.

Personal data that is inappropriately accessed or disclosed may constitute a data breach. The

GDPR requires organisations to keep a record of all data breaches and, where the breach is likely

to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals, the organisation must notify the

workers have a right to make a disclosure if there is a legitimate reason to do so; workers are protected under whistleblowing procedures; disclosures should be raised with the appropriate Investigating Officer; the need for confidentiality will be respected; all disclosures will be investigated following an agreed process; the outcome of the investigation, including the recommended course of action, will be reported to the CEO, the Audit and Risk Committee and to the whistleblower; if the whistleblower is not happy with the outcome of the investigation, they can report the matter to the proper authority.

*Information Commissioner* within 72 hours of becoming aware of the breach. If the data breach

results in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals, those individuals must be notified

without undue delay.

Section 43J of the *Employment Rights Act 1996* provides that a settlement agreement made between a worker and an employer cannot prevent future protected disclosures.

Any confidentiality obligations in contracts of employment that would prevent a worker making a

protected disclosure will be void.

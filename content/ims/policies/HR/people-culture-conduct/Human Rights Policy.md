# **Principle One: Human Rights**

---

### **Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights.**

---

## **What does it mean?**

This Principle sets out the UN Global Compact’s overarching expectation of business on human rights, namely, to respect and support human rights. Respecting human rights means a business should use due diligence to avoid infringing human rights (“do no harm”) and should address adverse human rights impacts with which they are involved. In addition, beyond respecting human rights, business is encouraged to take action to support human rights. This means seeing the opportunity to take voluntary action to make a positive contribution towards the protection and fulfillment of human rights whether through core business,strategic social investment/philanthropy, public policy engagement/advocacy, and/or partnerships and other collective action. Action to support human rights should be a complement to and not a substitute for action to respect human rights. Special attention should be paid to the rights of vulnerable groups, including women, children, people with disabilities, indigenous peoples, migrant workers, older persons etc.

## **Why should companies care?**

Respect for human rights is the right thing to do, but it is also a business issue. Not respecting human rights poses a number of risks and costs for business including putting the company’s social license to operate at risk, reputational damage, consumer boycotts, exposure to legal liability and adverse government action, adverse action by investors and business partners, reduced productivity and morale of employees.

While governments have the primary duty to protect, respect and fulfill human rights, other organizations and individuals have important complementary roles to play in respecting and supporting human rights. All businesses everywhere, regardless of size or sector and whether or not they are participants in the UN Global Compact, have the baseline responsibility to respect human rights. This has been recognized by the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (Download [Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights: Implementing the United Nations "Protect, Respect and Remedy” Framework](http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Publications/GuidingPrinciplesBusinessHR_EN.pdf).) [A joint note](https://unglobalcompact.org/library/1461) by the Global Compact and the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) on the relationship between the Guiding Principles and the commitments undertaken by Global Compact signatories, explains that the “Guiding Principles provide further conceptual and operational clarity for the two human rights principles championed by the Global Compact”.

Respecting and supporting human rights also strengthens a business’ relationships with its stakeholders. For example, workers who are treated with dignity and respect are more likely to be productive and remain loyal to an employer. New recruits increasingly consider the social, environmental and governance record of companies when making their choice of employer. Human rights and inclusive business models can also be a source of innovation for new products or services, access to new markets, help strengthen the social license to operate and to make the business a valued member of the community and society.

## **What can companies do?**

### **Respecting Human Rights**

Business has the potential to impact — positively and negatively — virtually all human rights. Accordingly, business should consider their potential impact on all rights. However, some actual or potential impacts will require special consideration, for example, where the actual or potential impacts are very serious and/or there is a strong connection between the company and the abuse.

For the content of human rights, at a minimum, companies should look to the [International Bill of Human Rights](http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Publications/FactSheet2Rev.1en.pdf) and the core [International Labour Organization (ILO) Conventions](http://www.ilo.org/global/standards/introduction-to-international-labour-standards/conventions-and-recommendations/lang--en/index.htm). The publication [Human Rights Translated](https://www.unglobalcompact.org/docs/news_events/8.1/human_rights_translated.pdf) elaborates the main internationally proclaimed human rights from a business perspective and offers practical examples of how companies have infringed on human rights as well as examples of how businesses have supported the enjoyment of the rights. Although some rights will be more relevant than others in particular circumstances, situations change, so broader periodic reassessment is necessary.

Business must comply with all applicable laws and respect internationally recognized human rights, wherever they operate. In the rare situation that national law directly conflicts with international standards, companies should seek ways to honour the principles of internationally recognized human rights. Please click here for our good practice note entitled “[Meeting the Responsibility to Respect in Situations of Conflicting Legal Requirements](https://www.unglobalcompact.org/docs/issues_doc/human_rights/Human_Rights_Working_Group/Conflict_of_Laws_GPN.pdf)”.

Importantly, the corporate responsibility to respect exists independently of States’ human rights duties. Among other things, this means that businesses have a responsibility to respect human rights whether they are operating in an area of weak governance or in a more stable context. In areas where there is weak governance, the risks of infringing human rights may be greater because of the context. For information on how to use conflict sensitive business practices in such contexts, see [Guidance on Responsible Business in Conflict-Affected & High-Risk Areas: A Resource for Companies & Investors](https://www.unglobalcompact.org/docs/issues_doc/Peace_and_Business/Guidance_RB.pdf).

### **Determining the scope of their responsibility**

Companies should consider three sets of factors in determining the scope of their responsibility to respect human rights or, in other words, the risk of potential negative impacts on human rights in connection with the conduct of their business:

- The first is to consider the country and local context in which it is operating for any human rights challenges that context might pose. Information about these is available from NGOs, Government, international trade unions and international organizations. There are also services that seek to bring such context specific risks together in formats more easily digested for business, for example, Danish Institute Country Risk assessments and Maplecroft Maps of Human Rights risks. These and other guidance material can be accessed from our [library](https://unglobalcompact.org/library/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&search%5Bkeywords%5D=&search%5Bissues%5D%5B%5D=121&search%5Bcontent_type%5D=&search%5Bsort_field%5D=)). Pay particular attention to the context in countries where laws are widely known to fall short of international standards and where enforcement may be inadequate.
- The second set of factors involves considering whether the company is causing or contributing to adverse human rights impacts through their own activities within that context — for example, in their capacity as producers, service providers, employers and neighbours ("activities" is understood to include both actions and omissions).
- Companies should then address those impacts by adjusting their policies and practices to prevent the infringement from occurring. An illustrative list of activities with direct impact might include the production process itself; the products or services the company provides; labour and employment practices; the provision of security for personnel and assets; and the company’s lobbying or other political activities.
- The third set of factors is an analysis of the company’s relationships with Government, business partners, suppliers and other non-State actors to consider whether they might pose a risk for the company in terms of implicating it in human rights abuse. Look particularly at the provision or contracting of goods, services and even non-business activities, such as lending equipment or vehicles. Consider the track records of those entities your company deals with to assess whether the company might contribute to or be associated with abuse caused by those entities. The responsibility to respect human rights also includes the Global Compact commitment to avoid complicity, that is, being involved in human rights abuse that another company, government, individual, group etc. is causing.

### **Policy Commitment**

Companies should adopt a statement of policy as a public commitment to fulfill their responsibility to respect human rights, approved by their board or equivalent. It can be a stand-alone statement or integrated into a broader corporate sustainability policy or code of conduct. Broad inspirational language may be used to describe respect for human rights, but more detailed guidance in specific functional areas is necessary to give those commitments practical meaning. The policy should stipulate the

company’s human rights expectations of personnel, business partners and those directly linked to the organization’s operations, products or services. As such, it should be communicated to these parties, as well as be publically available.

The policy should be informed by internal/external human rights expertise. Developing a human rights policy can also be an important opportunity for stakeholder engagement on the topic of human rights, which can be almost as important as the policy that results from the process. [View sample Human Rights policies](http://www.business-humanrights.org/Documents/Policies). Once prepared, the policy should be reflected in operational policies and procedures in order to embed it throughout the business functions. Download: [A Guide for Business: How to Develop a Human Rights Policy](https://www.unglobalcompact.org/docs/issues_doc/human_rights/Resources/HR_Policy_Guide.pdf).

### **Human rights due diligence**

In order to ensure and demonstrate (i.e. to know and show) that a company is meeting its responsibility to respect human rights it should undertake due diligence. Human rights due diligence is the ongoing process taken to identify, prevent and mitigate and account for negative human rights impacts which the company may cause or contribute to through its own activities or which may be directly linked to the company’s products, operations or services by a business relationship. Human rights due

diligence will vary in complexity with the size of the business, the risk of human rights impacts, and the nature and context of the business operations. The process should draw on internal and/or independent external human rights expertise and involve appropriate and meaningful consultation with potentially affected stakeholders. Tools and guidance materials are very helpful in this process. Comparable processes are typically already embedded in companies to assess and manage financial and related risks. Explore our [library](https://unglobalcompact.org/library).

Some particularly important elements of a comprehensive management approach to human rights include:

- **Assessing human rights impacts**: Many corporate human rights issues arise because companies do not consider the potential implications of their activities and relationships within their operating context. Companies should take proactive, ongoing steps to understand how existing and proposed activities may cause or contribute to human rights impacts, as well has how the company’s operations may be directly linked to such impacts. The scale of the review will depend on the industry, company size and national and local context and should be commensurate with the risk of severe human rights impacts. The process should draw on internal or external expertise and involve meaningful consultation with stakeholders, as appropriate. Based on the information uncovered, companies should refine their plans to address and avoid potential negative human rights impacts on an ongoing basis
- **Integration of human rights policies throughout a company**: The integration of human rights policies throughout a company may be the biggest challenge in respecting human rights. If awareness of human rights issues and their importance is not fully integrated across relevant internal functions and processes, inconsistent or contradictory actions can result. For example, product developers may not consider human rights implications; sales or procurement teams may not know the risks of entering into relationships with certain parties; budgets may not be properly allocated; and company lobbying may contradict commitments to human rights. Leadership from the top is essential to embed respect for human rights throughout a company, including by assigning responsibility for addressing impacts to the appropriate level and function within the business and developing an oversight process. It is important to train personnel to ensure consistency, as well as foster their capacity to respond appropriately when unforeseen situations arise
- **Taking action**: The appropriate action for a company to take will vary depending on whether (a) the company has caused or contributed to an impact, or (b) it is directly linked to that impact through its business relationships. In the case of (a), the company should cease or prevent the impact. In the case of (b) it should utilize available leverage to prevent or mitigate the impact
- **Tracking performance**: Monitoring and auditing processes permit a company to track ongoing developments. The procedures may vary across sectors and even among company departments, but regular reviews of human rights impact and performance are crucial. Tracking generates information needed to create appropriate incentives and disincentives for employees, ensure continuous improvement and to make necessary adjustments in priorities and approaches. Tracking should draw on feedback from both internal and external stakeholders. Confidential means to report non-compliance, such as hotlines, can be a useful source of feedback
- **Communicating/reporting on performance**: Reporting is a driver for change, externally as well as internally: It fulfils companies’ obligations to account for how they address human rights impacts; shapes stakeholders’ perceptions of a company and helps to build trust; and is increasingly acknowledged as a stimulus for internal development with a positive impact on business decisions and outcomes. Communications should be of a form and frequency that reflects the company’s human rights impacts, be accessible to the intended audience and provide enough information for stakeholders to evaluate the adequacy of the company’s response to impacts. Global Compact participants are required to communicate their progress on an annual basis. The Global Compact has developed a [Human Rights Supplement to Communication on Progress Guidance](https://www.unglobalcompact.org/docs/issues_doc/human_rights/Resources/HR_COP_Reporting_Guidance.pdf) to give practical guidance to businesses of all sizes wherever they are located on how to improve reporting on their implementation efforts, especially within the context of their annual Communication on Progress
- **Remediation**: A company should have in place or participate in remediation processes. This allows the company to address adverse human rights impacts that it has caused or contributed to. Effective company-level grievance mechanisms ensure that employees, contractors, local communities and others can raise their concerns and have them be considered. This can help companies to identify risks of negative impacts and avoid escalation of disputes

### **Supporting Human Rights**

In practice, respect and support for human rights are often closely interlinked in terms of the management steps that are taken to enable and ensure respect and support for human rights. For example, corporate policies on human rights often make positive commitments to support human rights, especially rights that may be strategically relevant to their business. Analyses of context, activities and relationships are likely to yield opportunities to promote human rights as well as possible risks of infringing rights. And companies often include in their reports information about the positive contribution they are making to human rights.

Supporting human rights involves making a positive contribution to human rights, to promote or advance human rights. Socially responsible organizations will typically have a broader capability and often desire to support the promotion of human rights within their sphere of influence especially in ways that link strategically to their core business activities. The business case for supporting human rights can be as strong as the business case for respecting human rights. Likewise, stakeholder expectations often extend to the belief that organizations can and should make a positive contribution to the realization of human rights where they are in a position to do so.

There are at least four ways business can support or promote human rights:

- Through their core business activities in support of UN goals and issues
- Strategic social investment and philanthropy
- Advocacy and public policy engagement
- Partnership and collective action

These are elaborated in the [Blueprint for Corporate Sustainability Leadership](https://unglobalcompact.org/library/229), which was adopted by the Global Compact participants at the Leaders Summit in June 2010. It makes clear that to be a corporate leaders on sustainability, business must not just avoid negative impacts, along with all other actors, but also make a positive contribution to society and do its part especially in ways relevant to its business in helping to overcome the most acute and chronic challenges.

Here are some examples of how companies are supporting and respecting human rights through their daily activities:

### **In the workplace:**

- by providing safe and healthy working conditions,
- by guaranteeing freedom of association,
- by ensuring non-discrimination in personnel practices,
- by ensuring that they do not use directly or indirectly forced labour or child labour,
- by providing access to basic health, education and housing for the workers and their families, if these are not provided elsewhere,
- by having an affirmative action programme to hire victims of domestic violence, and
- by making reasonable accommodations for all employees' religious observance and practices

### **In the community:**

- by preventing the forcible displacement of individuals, groups or communities,
- by working to protect the economic livelihood of local communities,
- by contributing to the public debate. Companies interact with all levels of government in the countries where they operate. They therefore have the right and responsibility to express their views on matters that affect their operations, employees, customers and the communities of which they are a part,
- through differential pricing or small product packages create new markets that also enable the poor to gain access to goods and services that they otherwise could not afford
- by fostering opportunities for girls to be educated to empower them and also helps a company to have a broader and more skilled pool of workers in the future, and
- perhaps most importantly, a successful business which provides decent work, produces quality goods or services that improve lives, especially for the poor or other vulnerable groups, is an important contribution to sustainable development, including human rights.
- If companies use security services to protect their operations, they must ensure that existing international guidelines and standards for the use of force are respected

### **Fostering Respect for Human Rights**

The topic of human rights can sometimes be challenging for a company to talk about with its managers and employees and/or those outside the company. However, promoting understanding about what human rights are, their relevance to business and what, in practical terms, business can do to address human rights issues can help to make action to respect human rights easier.

Some businesses find that looking at opportunities to support human rights as well as the risks of infringing human rights helps to motivate managers and staff to address risks too. Another approach some businesses find helpful is to start by looking at what the business is already doing to respect and support human rights, such as by having good human resources policies and practices, implementing policies on non discrimination and promoting diversity in the workforce, respecting the

privacy of customers and workers, undertaking efforts to make essential products more accessible to the poor and implementing effective occupational health and safety policies and practices. This helps to demystify human rights by showing that respecting human rights does not require starting from the very beginning. Nor does it need a whole new management system. Human rights can be integrated into existing business processes and procedures. Some companies find it helpful to look for the right entry point and language to discuss risks and opportunities with managers and staff. Sometimes it might be easier to begin the discussion by talking about familiar concepts like respect, dignity, fairness and equality, and specific scenarios with which managers and employees may be confronted. Companies investing in emerging economies may find it useful to discuss challenges to implementing Principles 1 and 2 in the Global Compact’s [Human Rights and Business Dilemmas Forum](http://human-rights.unglobalcompact.org/).

# **Principle Two: Human Rights**

---

### **Businesses should make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses.**

---

## **What does it mean?**

Complicity means being implicated in a human rights abuse that another company, government, individual or other group is causing. The risk of complicity in a human rights abuse may be particularly high in areas with weak governance and/or where human rights abuse is widespread. However, the risk of complicity exists in every sector and every country.

The requirement to respect human rights, pursuant to Global Compact Principle 1 and the [UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights](http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Publications/GuidingPrinciplesBusinessHR_EN.pdf), includes avoiding complicity, which is another way, beyond their own direct business activities, that businesses risk interfering with the enjoyment of human rights. The risk of an allegation of complicity is reduced (though not eliminated) if a company has a systematic management approach to human rights, including due diligence processes that cover the entity’s business relationships. Such processes should identify and prevent or mitigate the human rights risks with which the company may be involved through links to its products, operations or services.

### **Complicity is generally made up of 2 elements:**

- An act or omission (failure to act) by a company, or individual representing a company, that “helps” (facilitates, legitimizes, assists, encourages, etc.) another, in some way, to carry out a human rights abuse, and
- The knowledge by the company that its act or omission could provide such help

The commentary to Principle 17 of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights notes that “most national jurisdictions prohibit complicity in the commission of a crime, and a number allow for criminal liability of business” as well as allowing civil actions based on a company’s contribution to a harm. In the international context, the same commentary notes that “the weight of international criminal law jurisprudence indicates that the relevant standard for aiding and abetting is knowingly providing practical assistance or encouragement that has a substantial effect on the commission of a crime.”

However, allegations of complicity are not confined to situations in which a company could be held legally liable for its involvement in the human rights abuse committed by another. The media, civil society organizations, trade unions and others may allege complicity in a far broader range of circumstances, such as where a business may appear to benefit from another actor’s abuse of human rights, and may lobby the company to play an advocacy role. The better view is that the presence of a company in an area and payment of taxes where egregious and systematic human rights abuses are occurring, without more, is not enough to make the organization complicit in those abuses. However, some societal actors take a different view and may lobby business to play an advocacy role in such circumstances.

### **Accusations of complicity can arise in a number of contexts:**

- **Direct complicity** — when a company provides goods or services that it knows will be used to carry out the abuse
- **Beneficial complicity** — when a company benefits from human rights abuses even if it did not positively assist or cause them
- **Silent complicity** — when the company is silent or inactive in the face of systematic or continuous human rights abuse. (This is the most controversial type of complicity and is least likely to result in legal liability)

## **Why should companies care?**

The business rationale for taking action to avoid complicity is the same as for Principle 1. In other words, not only is it the right thing to do – there is also a growing business case. Several factors combine to place human rights higher on business’ list of priorities.

Human rights issues have become increasingly important as the nature and scope of business has changed. Different actors have different roles to play, and it is important for business to be aware of the contemporary factors that have made human rights an organizational issue.

- **Globalization:** The growth in private investment has witnessed companies expanding operations to countries previously untouched by global markets. In some instances, these countries have poor human rights records and/or the capacity of the state to address these issues is limited. In these cases the role of business in respecting and supporting human rights is particularly important
- **Growth of civil society:** In some instances, the capacity of the state to address human rights issues has diminished. As a result, a steady alienation of people has occurred towards the public institutions that were established to serve them. Non-governmental organizations of all types and sizes have grown to fill the void, progressively influencing both public policy and the market agenda. They include new human rights, labour and corporate accountability organizations
- **Transparency and accountability:** The need for transparency in business practice has been highlighted both by globalization, the growth of civil society interests and some recent problems in the corporate sector. Advances in information technologies and global communications mean that companies can ill afford to conceal poor or questionable practices
- **Crime:** Where an international crime is involved, complicity may arise where a company assisted in the perpetration of the crime, the assistance had a substantial effect on the perpetration of the crime and the company knew that its acts would assist the perpetration of the crime even if it did not intend for the crime to be committed
- **State-owned enterprises:** State-owned enterprises should be aware that because they are part of the state, they may have direct responsibilities under international human rights law

## **What can companies do?**

An effective human rights policy and conducting appropriate human rights due diligence will help companies address (though will not eliminate) the risk of being implicated in human rights violations, by knowing and showing that they took every reasonable step to avoid involvement.

### **Companies may wish to consider the following:**

- Has the company made a human rights assessment of the situation in countries where it does, or intends to do, business so as to identify the risk of involvement in human rights abuses and the company's potential impact on the situation?
- Does the company have explicit policies that protect the human rights of workers in its direct employment and throughout its supply chain?
- Has the company established a monitoring/tracking system to ensure that its human rights policies are being implemented?
- Does the company actively engage in open dialogue with stakeholder groups, including civil society organizations?
- Does the company utilize its leverage over the actor committing the abuse? If the company does not have sufficient leverage, is there a way to increase this leverage (e.g. through capacity building or other incentives or by collaborating with other actors)?
- Does the company have an explicit policy to ensure that its security arrangements do not contribute to human rights violations? This applies whether it provides its own security, contracts it to others or in the case where security is supplied by the State
- Ramifications of ending a business relationship, given the potential adverse human rights impacts of doing so

### **Actions that may be particularly helpful in avoiding complicity include:**

- ...respect international guidelines and standards for the use of force (e.g. the UN Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials and the UN Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials);
- ...if financial or material support is provided to security forces, establish clear safeguards to ensure that these are not then used to violate human rights and make clear in any agreements with security forces that the business will not condone any violation of international human rights laws;
- ...privately and publicly condemn systematic and continuous human rights abuses;
- ...continually consult within and outside the company with relevant stakeholders, as part of a human rights due diligence process, during both pre-investment and post-investment stages;
- ...raise awareness within the company of known human rights issues within the company’s sphere of influence;
- ...identify those functions within the firm that are most at risk of becoming linked to human rights abuses, possibly even at the pre-investment/project exploration and planning stage, and where there might be opportunities to advance human rights;
- ...conduct a human rights impact assessment consisting of an analysis of the functions of a proposed investment and the possible human rights impacts (intended and unintended) they may have on the community or region; and
- ...identify internal ‘functional risks’ in the post-investment situations. This may involve looking at such functions as purchasing, logistics, government relations, human resource management, HSE (health, safety and environment), sales and marketing

The High Commissioner is responsible to the United Nations Secretary-General for encouraging the international community and States to uphold universal human rights standards. OHCHR seeks to work with an ever-wider range of actors, including the private sector, to promote respect for human rights throughout the world. OHCHR is the focal point in the United Nations system for implementation of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, and has a mandate to lead the business and human rights agenda within the United Nations. OHCHR serves as secretariat for the United Nations intergovernmental body on human rights, the Human Rights Council, including its special procedures, such as the Working Group on Business and Human Rights, and inter-governmental working groups such as the one open-ended intergovernmental working group established to elaborate a legally binding instrument on human rights and transnational corporations. OHCHR has supported the human rights component of the United Nations Global Compact since it was launched in 2000. www.ohchr.org

The Guide in summary

1. Overview - what is a human rights policy?  It is a company’s public expression of its commitment to meet its responsibility to respect internationally recognized human rights standards. At a minimum, this means the rights set out in the International Bill of Human Rights and the principles concerning fundamental rights set out in the International Labour Organization’s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work

A human rights policy can take many forms and has no definitive template. However, some essential elements are set out in the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the global authoritative standard for business and human rights endorsed by the UN Human Rights Council in 2011.1  As a basis for embedding their commitment to respect human rights, the UN Guiding Principles provide that companies should express their commitment to meet this responsibility through a publicly available ‘statement of policy’. At a minimum, this commitment should encompass the rights set out in the International Bill of Human Rights2 and the principles concerning fundamental rights set out in the International Labour Organisation’s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work.3 The policy however does not unilaterally define the boundaries of the company’s responsibility.  The human rights policy sets out how the company respects human rights by having policies and processes in place to identify, prevent, mitigate and account for how it addresses its adverse human rights impacts. Many human rights policies also elaborate on the company’s commitment to support human rights, that is, to make a positive contribution to promote or advance human rights, in addition to the minimum requirement to respect human rights.4 Human rights policies explicitly use the words “human rights”, but can either be stand-alone statements or expressed within company statements of business principles, codes of conduct or other values-related statements and documentation.  The policy is approved at the most senior level of the business5 and sets out the company’s expectations of its personnel, business partners and other parties linked to the company’s operations, products or services.6 As such, it should be publically available and communicated internally and externally,7 and be reflected in operational policies and procedures so as to ensure that it is embedded throughout the company.8 To commensurate with this key role, the policy should be informed by relevant internal or external expertise, the level of which will differ depending on the complexity of the company’s operations.9  Adopting a human rights policy is a precursor to a company’s human rights due diligence towards meeting its responsibility to respect human rights. It sends a clear signal to internal and external stakeholders that the company is striving to embed human rights into its operational policies and procedures and to understand the human rights impacts of the business, both positive and negative. It also signals a commitment to take respect for human rights sufficiently seriously to allocate management time and resources to developing and implementing a policy, including by consulting externally.  A Guide for Business: How to Develop a Human Rights Policy seeks to outline why companies should respect human rights, the principal reasons for adopting a human rights policy, its key components and the best-practice processes to develop one.

2. Why respect human rights?

All companies have a responsibility to respect human rights, which means to avoid infringing on the human rights of others and to address these impacts where they occur, as set out in the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights  Companies that are participants of the United Nations Global Compact make a public commitment to respect and support human rights and comply with international standards  Respecting human rights is the right thing to do  Companies that respect human rights earn and secure their ‘social license to operate’, and avoid potentially costly company-community conflicts  Companies that respect human rights may better anticipate and manage operational and regulatory risks, and are well poised to comply with future legal and regulatory requirements  Companies that respect human rights may gain commercial benefits associated with good human rights practices, e.g., attracting investment, procurement, top-quality recruits and reputational benefits

SUMMARY: Why respect human rights?  All companies have a responsibility to respect human rights, which means to avoid infringing on the human rights of others and to address these impacts where they occur, as set out in the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights    Companies that are participants of the United Nations Global Compact make a public commitment to respect and support human rights and comply with international standards  Respecting human rights is the right thing to do  Companies that respect human rights earn and secure their ‘social license to operate’, and avoid potentially costly company-community conflicts  Companies that respect human rights may better anticipate and manage operational and regulatory risks, and are well poised to comply with future legal and regulatory requirements  Companies that respect human rights may gain commercial benefits associated with good human rights practices, e.g., attracting investment, procurement, top-quality recruits and reputational benefits Values: a universal responsibility  As the duty-bearers under international human rights law, governments have a duty to protect human rights. However, companies have a responsibility to respect international human rights standards, which means not to infringe on people’s rights and to address adverse human rights impacts that they cause, contribute to or which are directly linked to their operations, products or services by their business relationships.10  This universal responsibility is articulated in the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights11, which is structured around the three independent, but inter-related pillars of the “Protect, Respect and Remedy” framework: the State duty to protect human rights (Pillar I), the corporate responsibility to respect human rights (Pillar II) and access to remedy for victims of human rights abuses (Pillar III). Pillar II establishes the ‘Responsibility to Respect’ as the minimum global standard on human rights for all businesses wherever they operate. Put another way, the corporate responsibility to respect exists independently of States’ human rights duties. Among other things, this means that businesses have the responsibility to respect international human rights standards regardless of whether they are operating in an area of weak governance and/or domestic regulations that do not comply with international human rights, or in a more stable context. In areas where there is weak governance or a general lack of rule of law, the risks of infringing human rights may be greater.12 The UN Guiding Principles and the three pillar framework have widespread support from business and civil society. The responsibility to respect human rights is incorporated in Principles One and Two of the United Nations Global Compact. A joint note by the Global Compact and the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) on the relationship between the UN Guiding Principles and the commitments undertaken by Global Compact signatories, explains that the “Guiding Principles provide further conceptual and operational clarity for the two human rights principles championed by the Global Compact”.13 It is important to note that companies bear this responsibility to respect human rights even in the absence of a clear ‘business case’. However, many companies do find that respect for human rights is also beneficial for the business, as illustrated by the commercial and legal drivers outlined below.  Commercial  Many companies believe that showing respect for human rights gives them a competitive advantage over competitors that overlook the area.  Exercising human rights due diligence can help companies attract investment. Investment that favours good environmental, social and corporate governance is expanding14 and becoming increasingly mainstream, with asset managers like BlackRock, AXA Investment Manager, Calvert and HSBC all now offering funds with such criteria, some covering human rights. Indices like the FTSE4Good and Dow Jones Sustainability Index include human rights criteria in their performance indicators.15 And some national State pension funds and major public sector funds also screen on labour and human rights, e.g., the United States teachers’ and researchers’ pension fund TIAACREF (US$ 523 billion) and the Norwegian Government Pension Fund (US$ 893 billion).  In recent years soft law in human rights is becoming a greater focus for customers and who they choose to do business with. Many recent NGO campaigns have focussed on consumer concerns about, for example, improving respect for human rights in supply chains or the human rights elements of environmental impacts. The effective venue for enforcing the corporate responsibility to respect human rights is not the courtroom but the boardroom. As such, there has been a proliferation of ranking initiatives, such as the Access to Medicine Index16, Behind the Brands’ Scorecard17, and the forthcoming Corporate Human Rights Benchmark18, which will rank companies on their human rights performance, and the Ranking Digital Rights initiative, which will rank the world’s major Information and Communication Technology (ICT) companies on how they respect users’ rights to free expression and privacy.19      Good human rights practice can help attract new business, including public sector procurement, which represents an average of 12% of GDP across OECD countries.20 For example, suppliers of the Government of the Netherlands are expected to comply with specific human rights criteria.21 Similar examples are increasing as more governments respond to the call to prepare National Action Plans to implement the UN Guiding Principles.22  A growing number of smaller companies in the value chains of global companies are themselves developing an explicit human rights position23 including in order to attract business, because they know that many multinationals demand such standards of their suppliers and business partners.24 In recruitment, too, surveys show that corporate ethics is an increasingly important area; an increasing number of applicants ask hiring managers how company values, including on human rights, are translated into day-to day activities.25 Securing and maintaining a social licence to operate and avoiding potentially costly company-community conflict is another incentive. Increasingly, it is understood that a failure to respect human rights can also translate into operational risks for companies, for example by causing costly delays to projects and operations. Support for human rights can also be a source of innovation for the introduction of new product and service lines or adjustment to existing ones. Finally, various other international standards have been revised to reflect the content of the UN Guiding Principles, including the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and the International Finance Corporation’s Performance Standards on Environmental and Social Sustainability. Legal The responsibility to respect human rights is not a legal duty imposed on companies by treaty, but it is not a law-free zone either. The provisions of many international human rights treaties are embedded in domestic law (e.g., safety, health, anti-discrimination), and many Governments have adopted the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, which – depending on the provisions of their own criminal code – may mean that they are empowered to prosecute companies for certain international human rights violations.  Domestic legislatures are increasingly creating “hard law” in relation to respect for human rights, including mandating human rights due diligence. In the United States, the 2010 California Transparency in Supply Chains Act requires certain businesses to disclose the efforts they are making, if any, to eradicate human trafficking and slavery from their supply chains. In the UK, the Companies Act 2006 requires that company directors have regard to the impact of the company’s operations on the community26 and “quoted companies” must include information about human rights issues/policies in their strategic reports.27 Moreover, the UK’s Modern Slavery Act of March 2015 provides that commercial organisations must prepare a slavery and human trafficking statement annually detailing, among other matters, their due diligence processes in relation to slavery and human trafficking in their operations and supply chains.28 As of April 2015, there are proposals in both France29 and Switzerland30 concerning mandatory due diligence requirements.  Similar examples are likely to increase as states create national action plans (“NAPs”) to implement the UN Guiding Principles. According to the Business and Human Rights Resource Centre website, as of April 2015 seven states have developed NAPs and 23 more have committed to do so. Moreover, the Council of Europe has called on its member states to develop NAPs.31  Further, because the responsibility to respect human rights has become an international standard of conduct endorsed not only by the United Nations Human Rights Council but also by business associations, NGOs and Governments, failure to live up to that standard and infringing human rights can lead to calls for legal liability, or at least allegations that might be considered by nonjudicial grievance mechanisms, such as by a national contact point of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).32   25 “Recently, the idea has emerged that the key to winning the talent war through recruitment is to place greater emphasis on the reputation of an organization for social responsibility, not just a company’s overall reputation or its reputation as a good employer.” See http://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-much-does-a-companys-reputation-matter-in-recruiting/ (accessed 4 March 2015). 26 Section 172(1)(d) of the UK Companies Act 2006. 27 UK Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report and Directors’ Report) Regulations 2013, Section 414C(7) of the Companies Act 2006, as amended by the Strategic Report Regulations. 28 Modern Slavery Act 2015 (UK).

Finally, global momentum around the issue continues to build with the adoption of a resolution in the UN Human Rights Council, supported by 20 countries that established a working group to elaborate on a legally binding treaty on business and human rights.33

3. Why develop a human rights policy?  To provide a basis for embedding the responsibility to respect human rights through all business functions  To respond to relevant stakeholder expectations  To identify policy gaps and initiate a process that alerts the company to new areas of human rights risk  To elaborate on the company’s commitment to respect and support human rights  To build increased trust with external stakeholders and to start to understand and address their concerns  To foster the development of in-house learning, management capacity and leadership on human rights issues  To demonstrate international good business practice

Why develop a human rights policy? SUMMARY: Why develop a human rights policy?  To provide a basis for embedding the responsibility to respect through all business functions.  To respond to relevant stakeholder expectations  To identify policy gaps and initiate a process that alerts the company to new areas of human rights risk  To elaborate on the company’s commitment to support human rights.    To build increased trust with external stakeholders and to start to understand and address their concerns  To foster the development of in-house learning, management capacity and leadership on human rights issues  To demonstrate international good business practice To provide a basis for embedding the responsibility to respect through all business functions In order to ensure that the company’s responsibility to respect human rights is embedded through all business functions, it should express its commitment to do so by developing a human rights policy. Such a policy is the first step in showing that the company understands its responsibility to respect human rights. It provides the basis for publicly affirming company values and embedding the responsibility into company operations and the way it does business. To respond to stakeholder expectations As indicated above, there is an emerging international consensus about what steps companies should take to demonstrate their commitment to respecting human rights, most notably represented by the “Protect, Respect and Remedy” framework and the UN Guiding Principles. Having a human rights policy is explicitly required by the UN Guiding Principles,34 and increasingly expected by relevant stakeholders, including investors, business partners and Governments.  To identify policy gaps and alert the company to new areas of risk A company can both cause and contribute to adverse human rights impacts through its own activities. Further, it may find that its operations, products or services are directly linked to adverse impacts due to its business relationships. The company’s existing policies may not address all of these dimensions.  A company may not realize its potential to impact particular human rights without first identifying what human rights mean to the business. Developing a policy can be the catalyst. More and more companies worldwide report that developing and implementing a human rights policy has helped them see human rights risks and become better equipped to deal with human rights issues that arise. Existing policies may benefit from a human rights approach. For example, environmental policies can focus solely on technical solutions to perceived technical problems and miss the potential impact on communities and people’s rights. A human rights approach can also strengthen the consistency of existing company policies by demonstrating their alignment with universal values. 33 See: http://business-humanrights.org/en/binding-treaty (accessed 4 March 2015).  34 The “Guiding principles on business and human rights: implementing the United Nations ‘protect, respect and remedy’ framework” contain clear recommendations on the parameters of a company’s human rights policy commitment (A/HRC/17/31, Guiding Principle

Moreover, traditional risk management processes that focus on legal compliance and/or risks to the company (rather than risks to stakeholders) may miss key potential human rights impacts. As such, a human rights policy and commensurate implementation mechanisms can play a key role in mitigating/managing risks that may previously have been overlooked.   To build trust with stakeholders and address their concerns Adopting a human rights policy implies a commitment by the company to a human rights approach, through engaging with stakeholders, having appropriate transparency, and a human rights focus. Such an approach is rarely required by existing policies. Policies that focus only on the impact on the company may be inconsistent with a human rights approach, and miss risks. Making people part of the process by engaging with stakeholders can help companies build trust. A human rights policy shows a commitment to being a responsible corporate citizen and provides interested stakeholders with an accessible means of gauging company performance. Many companies also find that external stakeholders become more willing to engage constructively with them when they have a human rights policy and human rights approach in place, and will usually talk with the company before considering adversarial action, e.g., a boycott or litigation.  To trigger in-house human rights learning, management capacity and leadership  The very process of developing a human rights policy can have positive managerial spin-offs. Many companies say that developing the policy helped:  Raise awareness and understanding of the company’s human rights impact across departments  Build leadership commitment around human rights so that there was political support inside the company for resources to be assigned to policy implementation  Generate in-house managerial capacity, insights for future priorities and enthusiasm around the topic A human rights policy also provides managers with a public statement to frame responses to human rights questions. After preparing its “Approach to Human Rights” document, Cadbury reported that “the inspirational language used throughout the document helped motivate employees and stakeholders to show their support for the new vision.”35  To demonstrate good business practice It is increasingly becoming good international business practice to have a human rights policy or position statement. 24 of the FTSE 100 Index listed companies had such a policy in 2014, with 59 including human rights in their other policies.36 By March 2015, the Business & Human Rights Resource Centre had identified some 354 companies worldwide with an explicit human rights policy position. Its findings, which record only publicly available policies that explicitly use the term human rights, reflect a growing trend among businesses from all continents making a public commitment to respect and support human rights. An early example of this trend was also evident in the pledge signed by more than 250 global CEOs to mark the sixtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in December 2008.37 No more reasons not to have a policy Companies are seeing that by having a human rights policy they can start to better identify their potential human rights impacts, start to build in-house management capacity and demonstrate to stakeholders a sincere commitment to respect and support human rights. A BSR/Net Impact/GlobeScan poll of 700 business professionals from across the globe in late 2014 ranked uman rights as the most significant priority in CSR/sustainability for the year ahead.”38 Companies that are signatories to the United Nations Global Compact commit to aligning their strategies and operations with universally accepted principles in the areas of human rights and labour. According to a 2014 survey, 91% of UN Global Compact companies surveyed have a human rights policy in place.39 Further, empirical evidence illustrates that companies that are participants of the UN Global Compact are more responsive to civil society human rights concerns than nonparticipants.40 Why have relatively few companies globally backed up their pledges on human rights with a policy or other due diligence measures? Historical obstacles can partly explain it. Back in 2007, human rights remained, in the words of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on business and human rights, “mysterious for business” and companies did not fully know what was expected of them. Workplace issues aside, “human rights… were seen as the exclusive domain of States and no universally agreed framework” existed on the expectations of business.   However, an agreed international business and human rights framework now exists – the United Nations “Protect, Respect, Remedy” framework and the UN Guiding Principles for its implementation – applying to companies as well as States. In addition, there is a growing body of management guidance tools that help demystify human rights for business and map practical action. The business and human rights discourse has also become global and accessible to companies of all sizes and sectors; daily updates on the Business and Human Rights Resource Centre’s website41 now appear in many languages, based on research from every continent. In short, there are fewer and fewer reasons not to develop a human rights policy.

4. Key Steps - the process behind the policy Developing a human rights policy can be a dynamic, though not always a predictable, process. Do not expect perfection at first. Many companies update their policies as they gain experience with identifying and addressing their human rights impacts  Assign senior management responsibility to drive the process  Involve cross-functional personnel (human resources, legal, procurement, security, etc.) in the process to build understanding, know-how and a sense of common purpose  Identify and draw on internal and/or external human rights expertise  Map existing company policies to identify human rights coverage and gaps  Conduct a basic mapping of the company’s key potential human rights impacts  Consult internal and external stakeholders to identify and respond to their expectations  Communicate the policy internally and externally  Reflect human rights policy in operational policies and procedures

Key Steps   SUMMARY: Key steps  Developing a human rights policy can be a dynamic, though not always a predictable process Do not expect perfection at first. Many companies update their policies as they gain experience  Assign senior management responsibility to drive the process  Involve cross-functional personnel (human resources, legal, procurement, security, etc.) in the process to build understanding, know-how and a sense of common purpose  Identify and draw on internal and/or external human rights expertise  Map existing company policies to identify human rights coverage and gaps  Conduct a basic mapping of key potential impacts  Consult internal and relevant external stakeholders to identify and respond to their expectations  Communicate the policy internally and externally  Reflect human rights policy in operational policies and procedures

The development of a human policy can be a dynamic process. When first developing a human rights policy, managers should not feel under pressure to achieve perfection. Many best practice examples today took shape over several years and have undergone review.  Barclays developed its first human rights policy in 2004 under the sponsorship of the Group ViceChairman. It was signed off by the company’s Group Brand and Reputation Committee.42 The policy was revised in 2006, 2008 and again in 2010. “Policies and practices are updated to take account of new issues raised and growing awareness and familiarity within the business of the human rights impacts of our decisions. Policies are refreshed to keep them alive and topical and ensure they are communicated regularly.”43 Barclays PLC Each of the steps in this section is important, but the precise order can vary. Some companies report that they did not initially have senior management buy-in and that the impetus for a policy came from below, with the mapping analysis and stakeholder feedback being instrumental in winning senior management support and having resources assigned for policy implementation. No single sequence will suit every company. The timing of the policy’s release is largely a matter of choice. Some companies will release an initial short statement to raise in-house awareness or in response to stakeholder pressure, even before the other steps are complete; they may then follow up the initial statement with a longer policy document. Others release their human rights policy statement only when they are ready to integrate it into their management systems.  There can be overlap between the steps needed to draft a policy, to assess the company’s human rights impact and to integrate them both in the company’s management systems. However, mapping of potential risks and stakeholder consultation, for example, will be of a different magnitude when undertaken to inform a human rights policy versus when it is undertaken for an impact assessment.    Key steps  Put in place a crossfunctional team  Assign senior  management responsibility Conduct a preliminary gap analysis/policy mapping Identify and draw on internal and/or external human rights expertise Consult stakeholders on the human rights policy Communicate the policy internally and externally  Conduct basic mapping of key potential impacts Reflect human rights policy in operational policies and procedures Assign senior management responsibility. The decision to draft a policy is often made by the chief executive or by one or more senior executives. Whoever instigates the project, a member of senior management will typically need to be appointed to lead the process, sign off on the final policy and assign resources needed for its implementation. The UN Guiding Principles state that the policy commitment should be approved at the most senior level of the business.44   Some companies find that before beginning the drafting process, identifying and summarizing for senior management the “business case” for developing a policy can be a very useful exercise to gain or cement internal buy-in. This might include identifying the key business value drivers and benefits to the organization of preparing a policy, examples of actual or potential impacts on rightsholders caused, contributed to or linked to the company or industry, the potential impacts/cost of proceeding without a policy, benchmarking against industry peers and/or an explanation of where a policy fits into the broader road map towards addressing the company’s responsibility to stakeholders. Establish a cross-functional team. Many companies put in place a cross-functional team, committee or task force to help steer the policy through the company. Whether driven by a team or not, the company needs to capture in-house knowledge from across various business units and functions, consider varying legal jurisdictions, draft the policy and later communicate it internally and oversee training and reporting needs. In many cases, a team or committee will retain responsibility for the policy and any revisions in the medium to long term.45   Draw on internal and/or external expertise. Making basic policy decisions within the overlapping frameworks of a company’s existing standards and commercial management systems, while bearing in mind varying stakeholder expectations, can be demanding. Where human rights expertise exists internally, there is a strong case to keep the process largely in-house to ensure that any lessons learned stay within the company and help build capacity over time. However, where internal human rights expertise is lacking or the company’s business operations are particularly complex, external expertise should usefully be drawn from credible online or written resources or through consultation with recognized experts. Conduct a basic policy gap analysis/mapping exercise to determine which of the internationally recognized human rights are already covered by the company’s existing policies and identify any relevant ones that are missing.  Most companies find that longstanding corporate policies and codes of conduct already address human rights but that they do not use human rights language, e.g., policies on diversity, nondiscrimination, bullying or harassment, health and safety, minimum-age provision or working hours.  Drafting a human rights policy will not necessarily highlight entirely new issues for the business, but can help express and link together existing positions in a different way, or shine a light on issues that might otherwise get overlooked.  The UN Guiding Principles state that companies have a responsibility to respect all internationally recognized human rights, not just a select few, and a human rights policy needs to reflect this fact. Operationally, while companies need to be alert to all potential human rights risks, “in practice, some rights will be more relevant than others in particular industries and circumstances and will be the focus of heightened company attention. However, situations may change, so broader periodic assessments are necessary to ensure that no significant issue is overlooked.”46 In addition, companies also need to take into account the important principle of international human rights law that human rights are interdependent and indivisible, and that they cannot choose to ignore negative impacts on some human rights, while respecting others. Resource tip: When developing a policy, tools like Human Rights Translated: A Business Reference Guide can help managers become familiar with the full spectrum of human rights and identify which may have to be prioritized given the company’s unique geographical footprint, relationships, industry and operating context.  Conduct basic mapping of key potential impacts. Even during the first phase of developing a policy, many companies have found it helpful to do some basic mapping of the company’s key potential human rights impacts (or salient impacts) in order to inform the policy drafting process, and/or so that these salient impacts can be acknowledged in the text of the policy itself. In conducting this mapping, it may be helpful to consider industry guidance, known country risks or impacts and the experiences of other companies. This will need to be taken to another level during the impact assessment phase of human rights due diligence.  Resource tips: The Human Rights and Business Dilemmas Forum (www.hrbdf.org) allows users to search by human right or by country to identify known potential business impacts on human rights. The HRCA Quick Check (https://www.unglobalcompact.org/resources/29) allows companies to create a general overview of the human rights risks in their operations. Consult internal and relevant external stakeholders. In addition to ensuring that the policy is informed by relevant internal and/or external expertise, the company should identify key stakeholders. This is to help ensure that the policy is fit for purpose and addresses expectations and concerns of potentially affected groups and other relevant stakeholders. For example, workers and their representative organizations (trade unions) are important stakeholders for labour-related human rights; and engagement with them is generally referred to as “social dialogue”.47 Relevant stakeholders could also include industry peers that have already adopted a policy, those behind sector-based multi-stakeholder initiatives who have experience of advising companies in a similar position and business associations. Companies should also consider involving socially responsible investors, clients, civil society experts, consumers, campaign groups, academics and community groups. Involving potential critics in the process will give a reality check. Some companies share an early draft of the policy with stakeholders to elicit feedback. Some of the stakeholders that provide input into the policy will become useful allies during later due diligence phases. Communicate the policy internally and externally. No policy can be effective unless it is communicated. The policy should be publicly available. It needs to be disseminated to all employees to raise awareness and establish systems of accountability, and be coupled with relevant training. As is discussed below, it should also stipulate expectations of business partners and other relevant external parties and so should be communicated actively to those with whom the company has contractual relationships, others directly linked to its operations (e.g. security providers), investors, and, in the context of significant risks48, to potentially affected stakeholders. As the emphasis on transparency and “knowing and showing” respect for human rights increases, companies can only benefit from proactive communication about their progress on addressing human rights issues.  Reflect the human rights policy in operational policies and procedures. Establishing the policy is the first step in a process of actively addressing human rights issues. Companies should carefully consider how other policies and practices they have in place relate to the expressed commitment to respect human rights. Lack of coherence is a common risk; areas where discrepancies may arise include procurement and lobbying. If the human rights policy is not effectively reflected in other policies and procedures and embedded in management across all functions, neglect can quickly become reality even with all the best intentions in place. This issue also relates to the broader question of how to implement the company’s commitment to human rights, which is addressed in the final section of this Guide.

5. What are the key components of a human rights policy?  All policies – whether stand-alone or integrated – should at a minimum comprise:  An explicit commitment to respect all internationally recognized human rights standards – understood, at a minimum, as the International Bill of Rights and the ILO’s Declaration on the Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work  Stipulations concerning the company’s expectations of personnel, business partners and other relevant parties  Information on how the company will implement its commitment It may also contain:  An overview of the steps taken to develop the policy  Information on the company’s key human rights priority areas  A description of how the company will deal with conflicts between international human rights principles and applicable host-government legal requirements  A commitment by the company to “support” (i.e. contribute to the positive realization of) human rights  A summary of those human rights (including labour rights and others) that the business recognizes as likely to be the most salient for its operations and information on how it will account for its actions to meet its responsibility to respect human rights

Few human rights policies are the same. In the absence of regulatory guidelines, many companies simply do what fits best within the company’s existing policy commitments and internal processes. The UN Guiding Principles uses the generic term of a “statement”, leaving the concrete format of the document to the discretion of the company. Common conventions however do exist, many of which were identified by the Special Representative on business and human rights and his team during the first mandate (2005-2008),49 and many good practice policy examples can be found in the policy bank available via the Business & Human Rights Resource Centre’s website (www.business-humanrights.org).  SUMMARY: What are the key components of a human rights policy?  All policies – whether stand-alone or integrated – should at a minimum comprise:  An explicit commitment to respect all internationally recognized human rights standards – understood, at a minimum, as the International Bill of Rights and the ILO’s Declaration on the Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work  Stipulations concerning the company’s expectations of personnel, business partners and other relevant parties  Information on how the company will implement its commitment  It may also contain:  An overview of the steps taken to develop the policy  Information on the company’s key human rights priority areas  A description of how the company will deal with conflicts between international human rights principles and applicable host-government legal requirements  A commitment by the company to “support” (i.e. contribute to the positive realization of) human rights  A summary of those human rights (including labour rights and others) that the business recognizes as likely to be the most salient for its operations and information on how it will account for its actions to meet its responsibility to respect human rights  A stand-alone versus an integrated human rights policy? Human rights policies generally fall into two categories: stand-alone statements and policies that are integrated within the company’s wider standards literature, e.g., employee codes of conduct; ethical sourcing standards; environment, health and safety guidelines; and social/community investment commitments. Recently, there appears to be a gradual trend towards the integrated model (particularly among companies that have revised their policy approach at least once), but there are reasonable arguments in favour of either strategy and managers will need to determine for themselves which is better suited to their company.

"An advantage cited for free-standing procedures is that the relevant issues get the attention and professionalization they deserve. But a disadvantage may be that it is not connected to the rest of the company. In contrast, folding human rights due diligence into ongoing processes may put human rights on par with other key issues when managers evaluate potential projects, but the unique attributes of human rights may thereby get diminished.” Special Representative, April 200950 Stand-alone or free-standing policies have an advantage in external communication, making it easier for interested stakeholders to access information they require. Stand-alone statements are commonly employed by companies that are developing a human rights policy for the first time and allow the company to set out its intentions while it goes about building the requisite in-house knowledge and capacity to assess and manage its human rights impacts. For companies with well-established codes of conduct on employment or ethical sourcing guidelines, etc., the integrated approach may be easier to deliver and avoid a multiplicity of standards that could generate internal confusion. Integrated policies can suggest that human rights considerations are more deeply engrained within the company’s overall thinking, which can appeal to external stakeholders. Neither approach is right or wrong. A compromise option, which draws on both models, is to produce a readily accessible public human rights statement that cross-references established codes and policies, highlighting where the human rights-related elements can be found within existing management standards. This allows for effective communication and can sit well with current systems. It may, however, require new policy elements to be drawn up to address human rights issues that had previously gone unaddressed.  [Our] "Sustainability" policy has a specific section on Human Rights. …also the Management System Guidelines on Security and Planning and Controls that refer to the respect of human rights were issued. Eni S.p.A. Language tip: To gain buy-in within the company it is important to use practical, clear and concise language to explain the context and issues. Since much human rights language was originally designed for States, it can initially seem alien to business readers, so a company may need to make a few adaptations; stakeholder consultation can help ensure that both in-house and external stakeholders are comfortable with the end product. Some companies find that the inspirational language associated with human rights can actually be helpful in generating internal support.    We believe that the full respect of human rights and democracy are the best context to develop our operation, and that our commitment to human rights results from our Ethical principles more than from our legal obligations; we understand that implementing these principles adds value and competitiveness to the company. Cerrejón We recognize the important responsibility we have to respect human rights and we aim to bring the power of technology to bear to promote respect for human rights throughout the world. Microsoft Step 1: Consider fundamental elements A) A commitment to respect international human rights standards  Business activities can impact “virtually the entire spectrum of internationally recognized human rights”.51 As such, the statement of policy should make explicit use of the words human rights. Some stakeholders view policies that fail to use the words human rights less favourably.52 A good human rights policy should at a minimum refer to:   The Universal Declaration of Human Rights

The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights  The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights   The International Labour Organization’s (ILO) Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work53 [The Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the two Covenants are commonly referred to collectively as the International Bill of Human Rights.] If the activities of the company may have adverse effects on particular groups that may be at heightened risk of vulnerability or marginalization, additional standards in other international human rights instruments (such as those concerning indigenous people, certain minorities etc.) may need to be considered.54 In some cases where a company has significant interaction with a potentially vulnerable group, it may decide to prepare and refer to a separate, dedicated policy in relation to that group, e.g. an indigenous peoples’ or children’s rights’ policy (see further Section 5 below for resource tips in relation to specific rights and rights holders).  Reference to the company’s other external commitments may also be appropriate. Well-written policies also often contain a message about the meaning and value to the company of the commitment to respect human rights.  Process tip: In some countries the language of human rights is considered sensitive. Where managers encounter this they may find it helpful to explain to colleagues that the UN Global Compact received its mandate from the UN General Assembly, and thus enjoys the support of all 193 UN Member States.55  Some companies additionally refer to other relevant standards, such as the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and the ILO Tripartite Declaration of Principles concerning Multinational Enterprises and Social Policy.56 There are also voluntary initiatives, many of which have principles or codes that address a unique set of human rights challenges, for instance:   The United Nations Global Compact  The Ethical Trading Initiative  The Fair Labour Association  The Global Network Initiative  The Kimberley Process  The Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights (Extractive Sector) Examples of corporate policy statements: General statements of human rights commitment Novo Nordisk is committed to meeting its responsibility to respect human rights as defined by the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights [….] Novo Nordisk A/S ABB is committed to developing an organizational culture which implements a policy of support for internationally recognized human rights and seeks to avoid complicity in human rights abuses. We support the principles contained within the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and the ILO Core Conventions on Labour Standards. ABB Group Mitsubishi Corporation believes that respect for human rights is an important component of CSR in the development of its global business. [….] Mitsubishi Corporation also supports all international norms and codes regarding human rights, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the core labor standards of the ILO (International Labour Organization) and the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights. Mitsubishi 53 ILO considers its eight core conventions to be “fundamental” and they form the basis of the ILO 1998 Declaration of Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. These eight conventions underpin the four United Nations Global Compact Labour Principles, see A/HRC/14/27 and https://www.unglobalcompact.org/Issues/Labour/  54 See: http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CoreInstruments.aspx  (accessed 15 March 2015). 55 See General Assembly resolution 64/223 (para. 14). 56 Available at: www.ilo.org/empent/Whatwedo/Publications/lang--en/docName--WCMS_094386/index.htm (accessed 15 March 2015). 17

Our commitment to respect human rights and labour standards is based on the International Bill of Human Rights, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Labour Organization's (ILO) 1998 Declaration on Fundamental Rights and Principles at Work. Statoil [….] We respect international human rights principles aimed at promoting and protecting human rights, including the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights and the International Labor Organization’s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, and we actively participate in the United Nations Global Compact. The Coca-Cola Company B) Coverage of the policy The policy should clearly set out to whom it applies. If the policy applies to a corporate“group”, a definition of group companies is helpful. The UN Guiding Principles specify that companies should respect human rights throughout their operations; generally, a corporate policy would normally apply to at least all business units where a company has a controlling interest. However, depending on how the company is structured, in some cases business units may have separate or additional policies. The policy should also clearly state how it applies to relationships with suppliers and other entities with which the company does business.  Examples of corporate policy statements: “The Human Rights Policy applies to The Coca-Cola Company, the entities that it owns, the entities in which it holds a majority interest, and the facilities that it manages.” The Coca Cola Company The Diageo Human Rights & Anti-discrimination Policy applies to all Diageo employees and employees of subsidiaries and joint ventures where Diageo has a controlling interest. It also applies, as far as is reasonably achievable, to our upstream and downstream supply chain through partners, suppliers and third party contractors. In joint ventures where Diageo does not have overall control, the leaders and managers of those businesses are strongly encouraged to adopt the same or similar standards. If any human rights issues arise in joint ventures we will work actively with the business leaders to address them. Diageo  This Policy applies to all employees of ArcelorMittal subsidiaries and affiliates worldwide. In addition, our subcontractors working at our sites are expected to comply with this Policy. ArcelorMittal C) Stipulating expectations The UN Guiding Principles require that the statement of policy sets out the company’s expectations of its personnel as well as its business partners and other relevant parties, such as state governments. Examples of corporate policy statements: If any employee believes that someone is violating the Human Rights Policy or the law, they are asked to report it immediately to their manager, Human Resources, Company legal counsel or EthicsLine. The Coca Cola Company  Hitachi expects its business partners and other parties whose own impacts may be directly linked to Hitachi’s operations, products or services to respect and not infringe upon human rights, and will respond appropriately where they are not respecting human rights. Hitachi We seek to establish relationships with entities that share the same principles and values as Vale. We also promote human rights awareness and respect along our value chain, including the adoption of legal contractual clauses. In the event of disrespect to human rights, duly proven by government authorities and mechanisms provided by legislation, we notify the supplier/partner or the customer so they may adopt corrective measures and, in cases in which such measures are not taken, we then are entitled to rescind the respective commercial relationship. Vale D) Implementation mechanisms It can be useful to set out how the policy will be implemented within the company’s corporate processes, for example its risk management and oversight/monitoring mechanisms.

Examples of corporate policy statements: The Board of Unilever is responsible for ensuring adherence to these commitments and our senior management has responsibility for overseeing their implementation and ensuring that any breaches of our Code of Business Principles are investigated. Unilever Human Rights Due Diligence:  Recognizing the United Nations Guiding Principles of Business and Human Rights, we are striving to conduct human rights due diligence. Considering the impacts human rights violation can cause, we will prioritize appropriate actions to identify, prevent or mitigate those impacts in our value chains. We will regularly review and update the progress on our efforts, and annually communicate the results through our CSR report and other communication tools. Where we identify that we have caused or directly contributed to adverse human rights impacts, we would engage in appropriate remediation processes by ourselves or in cooperation with other stakeholders. Fujitsu Ltd. With Our Direct Business Partners: Incorporating appropriate principles of The Spirit & The Letter into contracts with suppliers, business partners and distributors. Monitoring adherence by key suppliers in emerging markets to environmental, health and safety standards, prohibitions against forced and child labor, and local wage and hour laws. Evaluating human rights issues involving our direct business partners— particularly in emerging markets—and considering practical responses within the relevant context. Advancing application of the ILO Declaration through engagement and collaboration. General Electric Step 2: Consider additional elements  A) An overview of the steps taken to develop the policy Often accompanying the human rights policy or position statement is an outline by the company of the policy’s scope and the steps it has taken to develop the policy/position statement. Overviews of this kind do not usually go into much detail but simply summarize some of the processes the company has undertaken to develop the policy, for example, if it appointed a cross-functional team, if any policy mapping exercise was carried out or how it consulted stakeholders.  Examples of corporate policy statements:  Senior management leadership and cross-functional task forces The importance ascribed to human rights by Eni… is also demonstrated by the fact that the CEO… has adhered to the initiative promoted by the High Commissioner for Human Rights as well as by the Global Compact document drafted at the time of the sixtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Eni S.p.A Yahoo has formally established a dedicated Business & Human Rights Program (BHRP) in order to lead our efforts to make responsible decisions in the areas of free expression and privacy. […]The BHRP has created a virtual, cross functional team in order to draw upon the expertise of Yahoo employees across the company to continue its centralized leadership on global strategy, industry initiatives, business decision-making, and internal and external stakeholder engagement. The virtual team is comprised of senior‐level employees in product, law enforcement, security, public affairs, corporate affairs, investor relations and global policy. The virtual team also includes employees in different geographies, including Asia, Europe, Latin America and the Middle East. Yahoo! Human rights mapping exercises This commitment follows an expert third-party review of our business to understand the extent to which ANZ policies and practices are meeting the requirements of these standards, with a particular focus on human rights. The review assessed ANZ's performance against guidelines set out in global human rights instruments […]. It found that ANZ complied with, and in many cases exceeds, most criteria in Australia and New Zealand […]. The review also found more work was required to understand and mitigate human rights risks in our supply chain, our lending decisions in our institutional business and our operations and partnerships in Asia, Pacific and India. […].Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited (ANZ bank)

Stakeholder consultation We listen to the views of our stakeholders. For customers, shareholders, employees and suppliers we have formal ways of doing this [including] specific mechanisms […] to encourage open feedback. We have engaged our employees […] through our representation committees, known as Business Involvement Groups and carried out an anonymous survey to gauge their views. […] During the last year, we carried out detailed research with our customers. […] We also had regular discussions with Government, regulators, community partners, trade associations as well as environmental, human rights and animal welfare groups […]. CSR [corporate social responsibility] is constantly evolving as expectations change and new issues emerge. This means that whilst our approach to CSR is underpinned by a core set of values, it also has to be adaptable and flexible. Marks & Spencer B) Setting human rights priorities Companies have a responsibility to respect all internationally recognized human rights. However, in practice, some human rights risks will likely be more salient than others, and thus need particular focus. Some companies prefer to highlight their particular human rights priorities and risks in their policy statements. As human rights situations may change, though, companies should both ensure that they respect all human rights and periodically review their human rights priorities.  Example of corporate policy statement:  We believe our main responsibilities lie in a number of critical areas: employee rights, the right to access finance for vulnerable and disadvantaged members of the community and the risk of human rights violations within our supply chain. The Westpac Group C) Legal jurisdiction issues The corporate responsibility to respect human rights exists independently of the need to comply with national laws and regulations protecting human rights. Challenges may arise when national law directly conflicts with international human rights standards or does not fully comply with them. In such circumstances, companies are expected to seek ways to respect internationally recognized human rights.57  Examples of corporate policy statement:  Hitachi adheres to national law and regulation in each market in which it operates. Where Hitachi faces conflicts between internationally recognised human rights and national laws, the company will follow processes that seek ways to honour the principles of international human rights. Hitachi  The working conditions of our employees are, at minimum, in compliance with internationally recognized labor standards and the laws of the countries we operate in. Compliance with the ILO’s core labor standards is mandatory for us worldwide. This includes the prevention of child and forced labor, adherence to the principle of non-discrimination in the workplace, the right of freedom of association and assembly, and the right to collective bargaining. This applies provided national law does not explicitly prohibit adherence to the ILO core labor standards. In such cases, we develop innovative approaches to promote the adoption of the principles that form the foundation of these international standards. BASF D) Commitment to support human rights  Some companies also elaborate on the company’s commitment to support human rights, that is, to make a positive contribution to human rights. The UN Global Compact encourages companies to take additional voluntary actions to support human rights whether through core business activities, strategic social investment and philanthropy, public policy engagement and advocacy or 57 See Annie Golden Bersagel, “Meeting the Responsibility to Respect in Situations of Conflicting Legal Requirements”, Good Practice Note (United Nations Global Compact, 2011), Available at: https://www.unglobalcompact.org/docs/issues_doc/human_rights/Human_Rights_Working_Group/Conflict_of_Laws_GPN.pdf

partnership and other forms of collective action. The responsibility to respect human rights is a baseline expectation, and a company cannot compensate for human rights harm by performing good deeds elsewhere.58 Such commitments must be a complement, and not substitute or trade off for a company’s responsibility to respect international human rights. Examples of corporate policy statements: We operate across vast geographic locations, including areas where social, economic and political factors may put human rights and acceptable working conditions at risk. Our actions to support and respect human rights in these areas help us to live up to our commitment to do no harm and to leave communities better off.  AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. We are committed to ending Indigenous disparity and have in place a dedicated program that provides the required skills and addresses barriers to employment for Aboriginal people. We require our supply chain to help in our efforts to end Indigenous disparity through the provision of skills and employment. Fortescue Metals Group [….] In addition to working with respect for human rights, we pursue opportunities to support human rights where we can make a positive impact. Novo Nordisk A/S Step 3: Provisions on human rights for workers Human rights policies/position statements often include provisions on the human rights of workers who directly or indirectly perform work linked to the company. For large companies these issues may already be covered under existing employee codes of conduct; the policy-mapping exercise referred to in the “Key Steps” section above should help identify any gaps.  The level of detail a company goes into will vary. Some offer a short sentence on key labour rights issues that outline their commitment. Others refer stakeholders to company literature, such as codes of conduct, where additional detail is to be found. Some companies publicly disclose more than others.  More detailed provisions may be needed for some rights if the company operates in countries where a particular right is known to be at special risk, or if the industry faces a unique rights challenge. For example, retail companies with operations where child labour is prevalent may have more detailed child labour provisions than companies for whom the risk of child labour is low.  Key human rights-related areas regularly covered in human rights policy documentation include:  Accessibility for persons with disabilities  Child labour/minimum age workers/worst forms of child labour  Employment relationship  Equality  Fair wages/compensation  Forced/bonded/compulsory labour  Health and safety  Maternity protection  No harsh or degrading treatment/harassment  Non-discrimination  Right to form or join a trade union and to bargain collectively   Right to strike  Working conditions - including working hours Resource tips: The ILO Tripartite Declaration of Principles concerning Multinational Enterprises and Social Policy provides guidance to companies on human rights at work and is a valuable resource for companies developing a human rights policy. ILO has developed a resource platform specifically for business called the ILO Help Desk for Business: www.ilo.org/business. Specific questions can be submitted via assistance@ilo.org.   Global Framework Agreements: More than 100 multi-national enterprises have signed agreements with global trade union organisations (Global Union Federations) covering labour rights. Such agreements are company policy and can be part of the due diligence process.59 Examples of corporate policy statements:  Child labour  As per Chilean law and conventions ratified by Chile, children under 18 are not allowed to work in operations or jobs requiring excessive force, nor in activities that may be hazardous to their health or safety. Those under 21 years require pre-employment medical examinations to work in underground mines. […] Codelco adheres to the principles established in the Convention on the Rights of the Child of the United Nations, and in Convention 138 of the ILO. Codelco Child labour is not used. There is no recruitment of child labour. If any incidence of child labour is identified in the supplier’s industry and region, the supplier shall initiate, or participate in, a programme to transfer any children involved in child labour into quality education until they are no longer children.  No one under eighteen years old is employed at night or in hazardous work or conditions.  In this Code, "child" means anyone under fifteen years of age, unless national or local law stipulates a higher mandatory school leaving or minimum working age, in which case the higher age shall apply; and "child labour" means any work by a child or young person, unless it is considered acceptable under the ILO Minimum Age Convention 1973 (C138). Pentland Group plc  Employment relationship GDF SUEZ recognizes the importance of secure employment for both the individual and for society through a preference for permanent, open ended and direct employment. GDF SUEZ and all sub-contractors shall take full responsibility for all work being performed under the appropriate legal framework and, in particular, shall not seek to avoid obligations of the employer to dependent workers by disguising what would otherwise be an employment relationship or through the excessive use of temporary or agency labour… ICEM (now IndustriALL), BWI, and PSI agreement with GDF Suez (now Engie) (2010)   Hiring Contract and Temporary Employees to Full-Time Positions: Sysmex Corporation actively hires contract employees and temporary employees as full-time personnel. We have clarified our internal regulations for hiring people working on limited, fixed-term contracts, offering them fair opportunities for promotion. We put this information on our intranet to encourage thorough understanding of these rules. When renewing temporary employees’ contracts, for employees that meet certain conditions we notify temporary placement agencies of the possibility of employing such personnel directly. Sysmex Fair wages/compensation To give workers remuneration which satisfies their basic needs and those of the members of their family who are directly dependent on them. Carrefour S.A.  Every worker has a right to compensation for a regular work week that is sufficient to meet the worker’s basic needs and provide some discretionary income. Our business partners must pay at least the minimum wage or the appropriate prevailing wage, whichever is higher, comply with all legal requirements on wages, and provide any fringe benefits required by law or contract. If the compensation paid does not meet the workers’ basic needs and provide some discretionary income, our business partners are required to take appropriate actions that seek to progressively realize a level of compensation that does. PVH Corp.  Forced/bonded labour Business partners must not use forced labour, whether in the form of prison labour, indentured labour, bonded labour or otherwise. No employee may be compelled to work through force or intimidation of any form, or as a means of political coercion or as punishment for holding or expressing political views.

We are proactively and progressively engaging with our supply chain on each of these issues. Our approach is in keeping with Fortescue’s Code of Conduct and aligned with the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the United Nations Global Compact. Fortescue Metals Group Freedom of association/collective bargaining The rights of the employees to choose to be a member of a trade union and to bargain collectively as permitted by local laws and regulations must not be interfered with or restricted. In situations or countries in which the rights regarding freedom of association and collective bargaining are restricted by law, parallel means to freedom of association and collective bargaining must be facilitated for all personnel by the vendor. The Lego Group UNI and Telefónica reaffirm their support for the fundamental human rights in the workplace, in particular freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining. In that regard, the company is committed to complying with the ILO Conventions concerning freedom of association and trade union rights and to recognising the right to organise and the right of unions to represent and negotiate on behalf of the workers, without prejudice to existing local legislation.

A brief introduction to International Labour Standards, ILO, Department of International Labour Standards, Geneva, 2009 (rev. ed.)  ILO Helpdesk for Business on international labour standards (www.ilo.org/business) Step 4: Provisions on non-labour related rights issues Each company will need to determine for itself which given human rights may need to be prioritized – whether because they pose unique challenges to the company’s industry and its relationships or because the company does business in one or more high-risk locations – and whether these merit a specific policy provision. At the same time, it is important to note that even if the particular operating conditions of a company mean that some rights are at greater risks than others, the responsibility to respect applies to all internationally recognized human rights. Thus, while not all human rights issues may merit specific policy provisions at a given point in time, the policy should nevertheless stress the company’s commitment to respect all human rights. To raise awareness internally that human rights risks may change as situations evolve, the policy should also stipulate that it will be subject to review if proven inadequate through the company’s ongoing human rights due diligence process. Companies do not always use human rights language to describe policy provisions that address non-labour rights issues; for example, company security arrangements may impact on the rights to life and security of persons, but will normally be listed by the company as a policy on security arrangements, rather than a policy on the right to life.

Next Steps - Path to Implementation Developing a human rights policy is only the first step for a company to know and show that it respects human rights. Embedding it throughout the relevant processes and procedures of the whole business is necessary to ensure its effective implementation. A properly embedded human rights policy will guide the human rights due diligence process that is necessary for a company to know and show that it respects human rights. Human rights due diligence is the ongoing process taken to identify, prevent and mitigate and account for negative human rights impacts which the company may cause or contribute to through its own activities or which may be directly linked to the company’s products, operations or services by a business relationship. The process will vary in complexity with the size of the business, the risk of human rights impacts, and the nature and context of the business operations. Like the policy creation process, human rights due diligence should draw on internal and/or independent external human rights expertise and involve appropriate and meaningful consultation with potentially affected stakeholders. A human rights due diligence process comprises the following elements: (a) (b) An assessment of the company’s actual and potential human rights impacts Integration of the assessment’s findings across relevant internal functions and processes in order to ensure that potential adverse human rights impacts are effectively prevented and mitigated, and that actual impacts are remediated, as appropriate (c) Tracking the effectiveness of the responses taken to address actual and potential impacts through monitoring processes, including providing for or cooperating in the remediation of negative human rights impacts the company has caused or contributed to  (d) Tracking progress, through appropriate metrics and systems and being prepared to communicate how human rights impacts are addressed In addition to instituting a process of on-going human rights due diligence, companies are expected to have in place processes to enable the remediation of any adverse impacts that they cause or contribute to. When companies identify that they have caused or contributed to adverse impacts, they should either provide for remedy or cooperate in their remediation through legitimate processes. Remediation may be achieved through judicial mechanisms or non-judicial mechanisms such as dialogue, mediation, or arbitration.  The key is to ensure that the human rights policy becomes more than just a piece of paper. Having a policy and doing nothing to implement it can potentially be worse than having no policy at all. Failing to act, or acting inadequately, in contradiction with a policy, can open a company to criticism from a wide variety of sources, not just human rights NGOs but also those who look at the integrity of its corporate governance. Implementation is therefore critical. Key points to consider when moving towards implementation of the human rights policy Assessing impact  Undertaking a human rights baseline study for the business, including country-risk analyses  Undertaking a human rights impact assessment at the time of acquisitions, engagement with new business partners and at the pre-feasibility stage of any major new project with the potential to negatively impact human rights, and on an ongoing basis as human rights risks may change over time. Some high risk operating contexts, such as conflict-affected areas, will require additional attention and heightened due diligence  As part of their human rights approach, consulting potentially affected groups and other stakeholders in a meaningful way, with particular attention to vulnerable groups  Assessing impacts from the perspective of impacted stakeholders, and prioritising action based on the severity and likelihood of impact to these stakeholders. For most companies, this will represent a subtle but significant departure from generic risk management frameworks which tend to focus on risks to the company Note: In many cases, it is not possible to assess all the potential or actual human rights impacts a business has across all the areas of its value chain. This is particularly the case for businesses that have long or complicated supply chains. In these instances, businesses should identify areas where the risk of adverse impacts is most significant (salient human rights impacts) and prioritise these areas for human rights due diligence.  Integrating human rights throughout the company  Integrating and acting on the findings of the impact assessment  Engaging in ongoing stakeholder consultation to build relationships across the company and with external groups  Reviewing company training to include human rights criteria as appropriate and identifying target groups that may need additional learning support  Embedding human rights into management systems, including responsibilities in job descriptions and performance appraisals  Designing or revising relevant business processes to incorporate due diligence. This may include mergers and acquisition processes and checklists, existing risk management systems or audit programs and processes to engage or manage relationships with business partners (e.g. dealers, franchisees, suppliers, licensees or customers) such as supplier pre-selection processes, capacity building activities and/or audit programs  Revising the language of policies, procedures, operating procedures or other company documents to reflect the revised system, people and process changes  Integrating human rights into the company’s internal and external communications, e.g., Intranet or Web 2.0 systems, to ensure relevant stakeholders understand the policy and business implications of not adhering to it or failing to act on impact assessment findings Taking action and tracking performance  Taking action to address actual or potential impacts. The UN Guiding Principles provide that the action that the company should take will vary depending on whether (a) the company has caused or contributed to an impact, or (b) it is directly linked to that impact through its business relationships63  Identifying indicators for measuring human rights performance, developing and implementing systems for acquiring qualitative and quantitative data, drawing on both internal and external feedback, including from affected stakeholders, and reviewing the findings to inform future strategy Communicating on how impacts are addressed  Having in place systems for tracking the effectiveness of the actions taken to address potential or actual human rights impacts  Publically communicating on commitments, targets and performance (including through the Global Compact Communication on Progress for United Nations Global Compact participants). The communication should be of a form and frequency that reflects the enterprise’s human rights impacts and that is accessible to its intended audiences  The communication should provide information that is sufficient to evaluate the adequacy of an enterprise’s response to the particular human rights impact Resource tip: The UN Guiding Principles Reporting Framework aims to help companies meaningfully report on their human rights performance.   Remediation  If a company finds that it has caused or contributed to negative human rights impacts, it is expected that it engages actively in remediation  The company should provide for or cooperate in the remediation of such impacts through legitimate mechanisms  Establishing or participating in operational-level grievance mechanisms can be an effective means of providing access to remedy for individuals and communities that may be adversely impacted by the company’s activities if these mechanisms meet certain criteria.64 Effective remediation processes can also help prevent impacts from escalating further  However, it should be noted that grievance mechanisms should neither be used to undermine the role of legitimate trade unions in addressing labour-related disputes, nor to preclude access to judicial or other non-judicial grievance mechanisms KEY READINGS: Next steps - the path to implementation  UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (as above).  The Corporate Responsibility to Respect Human Rights: An Interpretive Guide (as above).  Human Rights Compliance Assessment Quick Check (as above)  Human Rights and Business Dilemmas Forum: www.hrbdf.org.   Human Rights and Business Country Guide, Danish Institute for Human Rights.

Human rights policies for small and medium-sized enterprises The universal baseline expectation that companies should respect human rights applies to all companies regardless of size. Many of the legal pressures and some, though not all, of the commercial drivers for respecting human rights apply equally to big and small companies. For companies to show respect for human rights requires due diligence, of which a human rights policy is only the first step. How companies go about this in practice will depend considerably on the resources available, as well as the level of the company’s risk of negatively impacting human rights.   It is not unusual for multinational companies to have formal policies and procedures to ensure that non-financial issues like human rights are properly addressed company-wide, including across functions and business units, whereas such policies are rare or non-existent among small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Human rights, however, are a new consideration even for many large companies and in the absence of a uniform template or regulation governing human rights policies, SMEs and multinationals alike can draw upon examples in this Guide to help develop a policy or position statement that is best suited to their own circumstances.  SMEs are reminded that many larger companies’ human rights policies often started as or even remain statements that are just a few paragraphs long; this may be the best model. In developing a human rights policy specific to their needs and situation, SMEs could check that their human rights policy/position statement shows that they have:  Given overall responsibility for the policy to a senior figure in the company;   Taken steps to understand the human rights issues that might be relevant (human rights focus);  Involved colleagues from all departments or teams; and   Talked with and listened to their stakeholders, possibly including those that may be affected by company activities. And that the human rights policy or statement at a minimum has a sentence that is:  An explicit commitment by the company to respecting human rights that refers to internationally recognized human rights standards.  In a small enterprise with very limited human rights risks, it may be sufficient to provide a policy note to staff, highlighting the responsibility to respect human rights and key issues for their attention (for example, non discrimination), what this means for staff practices and what accountability there will be (including the consequences for breaches).

6. Next steps - Path to implementation  Assessing the company’s human rights impacts and risk areas, including country analyses, new operation assessments and stakeholder consultation  Integrating human rights throughout the company, looking at business processes, training, communication, management systems, etc.  Taking action and tracking performance, including by identifying progress measurement indicators  Communicating on how impacts are addressed  Providing for or cooperating in remedying an adverse human rights situation that a company has caused or contributed to through legitimate processes, including establishing or participating in effective operational-level grievance mechanisms for individuals and communities that may be adversely affected by the company’s activities

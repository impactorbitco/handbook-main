**Introduction**

While Green Orbit Digital rarely has the opportunity to accommodate interns within our small business, when we do, we aim to ensure that the experience is both enriching and mutually beneficial. Our internship program is designed to provide valuable learning opportunities for students and recent graduates while contributing to the development of talent within our organization and the broader industry.

**Objectives of the Internship Program**

1. **Hands-on Learning:** Offer interns practical, hands-on experience in their chosen field to complement their academic studies.
2. **Talent Pipeline:** Identify and nurture emerging talent, providing interns with valuable skills and connections that may benefit both the organization and the industry.
3. **Mentorship and Support:** Provide mentorship and guidance to interns, supporting their professional development and growth.
4. **Practical Experience:** Create a learning environment where interns can apply theoretical knowledge in real-world scenarios, gaining practical insights and skills.
5. **Positive Work Environment:** Foster a positive and inclusive workplace culture where interns feel valued, supported, and encouraged to contribute.
6. **Networking Opportunities:** Facilitate networking opportunities for interns to connect with professionals in their field and expand their professional network.
7. **Feedback and Evaluation:** Provide regular feedback and evaluations to interns, helping them to identify areas for improvement and grow professionally.
8. **Organizational Integration:** Introduce interns to the organization's culture, values, and operations, allowing them to make meaningful contributions to our success.

**Remuneration**

All interns participating in our program will receive compensation in accordance with our standard employment policies, ensuring they are paid a fair and living wage for their time and contributions.

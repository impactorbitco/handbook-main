Status: Not started
Version Number: 1.1

**Statement and Purpose of Policy**

1. __________ (the **Employer**) is committed to providing an inclusive and supportive working environment to all staff members throughout all stages of their working lives.
2. The Employer recognises that staff experiencing the menopause, whether before (i.e. perimenopause), during or after the period of hormonal change and associated symptoms, may need additional consideration, support and adjustments.
3. The Employer recognises that the menopause and menopausal symptoms may not only affect women but also non-binary, transgender and intersex people.
4. The Employer is committed to creating and providing a supportive work environment, so that anyone experiencing the menopause feels confident raising any issues they may have due to their menopausal symptoms and requesting reasonable adjustments at work.
5. This Policy forms part of the Employer’s commitment to ensuring the health, safety and overall well-being of its workforce. This Policy is designed to prevent menopausal symptoms experienced by staff from being exacerbated in the workplace.
6. This Policy does not form part of any employment contract and the Employer retains the right to amend it at any time, in its absolute discretion.

**Scope**

1. This Policy applies to all employees, irrespective of seniority, tenure, and working hours, including all directors and officers, casual or agency staff, trainees, interns, fixed-term staff, volunteers, workers and contractors (the **Staff Members**).

**Aims of This Policy**

1. The Employer understands its obligations under relevant health and safety legislation and the Equality Act 2010 and is committed to ensuring equality and diversity in the workplace. This Policy, alongside the Employer’s Health and Safety Policy, Equal Opportunities Policy and other equality and diversity policies, including the Employer’s Anti-Harassment and Bullying Policy, implements part of this commitment to equality and diversity.
2. This Policy aims to:
    1. Make managers aware of the menopause, its symptoms and how it may affect Staff Members.
    2. Make managers aware of how they can support Staff Members experiencing the menopause at work.
    3. Create and maintain a positive and supportive working environment, in which Staff Members feel able to speak freely and openly about the menopause in a respectful and supportive manner.
    4. Raise awareness and understanding about the menopause, its symptoms and potential effects among all Staff Members.
    5. Enable Staff Members experiencing the menopause to continue to work effectively in their role.
    6. Outline what support and reasonable adjustments are available to Staff Members experiencing the menopause.
    7. Help the Employer recruit and retain Staff Members who are experiencing the menopause.

**What is the Menopause?**

1. The menopause occurs when the body’s oestrogen levels fall and the body no longer releases eggs.
2. The menopause is part of the normal ageing process and usually affects those between the ages of 45 and 55. However, the menopause may also:
    1. Occur early, before the age of 40 (known as ‘premature menopause’).
    2. Be brought on suddenly through medical or surgical intervention (known as ‘medical/surgical menopause’). For example, because the ovaries are damaged or removed or due to an underlying health condition.
3. The menopause can be divided into different phases:
    1. Perimenopause is the period leading up to the menopause, where symptoms may be experienced. This can begin several years before the menopause.
    2. Menopause is when someone’s period stops altogether. This phase is considered to have started when someone hasn’t had a period for 12 months.
    3. Post-menopause is the period after the menopause. Menopause symptoms tend to continue for a while during post-menopause.
4. Throughout this Policy, the term ‘menopause’ refers to all phases of the menopause.

**Symptoms of the Menopause**

1. The menopause can result in various physical, mental and emotional symptoms. These menopausal symptoms include, but are not limited to:
    1. Hot flushes;
    2. Heart palpitations;
    3. Headaches and migraines;
    4. Muscle aches and joint pains;
    5. Difficulty concentrating;
    6. Memory problems;
    7. Mood swings; and/or
    8. Difficulty sleeping.

For more information on menopausal symptoms, see the [NHS guidance](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/menopause/symptoms/) (https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/menopause/symptoms/).

1. The Employer recognises and acknowledges that:
    1. The menopause may not be an easy process for everyone.
    2. The menopause can affect physical, psychological and emotional health and can, as a result, significantly impact an affected Staff Member’s ability to work and their relationships with colleagues.
    3. Everyone’s menopausal symptoms are different and Staff Members may have unique experiences with the menopause.

**The Equality Act 2010**

1. While the Equality Act 2010 does not specifically address the menopause, any unfair treatment due to the menopause may amount to discrimination based on the protected characteristics of sex, age, disability or gender reassignment.
2. Staff Members experiencing menopausal symptoms may be protected under the Equality Act 2010 from prohibited conduct in the form of discrimination, harassment, victimisation or the Employer’s failure to make reasonable adjustments. For more detailed information on these types of prohibited conduct, see the Employer’s Equal Opportunities Policy.
3. Under the Employer’s Anti-Harassment and Bullying Policy, Staff Members experiencing menopausal symptoms are also explicitly protected from bullying.

**Disability and Reasonable Adjustments**

1. Under the Equality Act 2010, the menopause in itself is not a disability. However, if menopausal symptoms have a long-term adverse effect on the ability of a Staff Member to carry out normal day-to-day activities, it may be considered a disability. The Employer has a duty to make reasonable adjustments to alleviate disadvantages caused by a disability.
2. Even where a Staff Member’s menopausal symptoms do not amount to a disability, the Employer will consider making adjustments to support the Staff Member and enable them to fulfil their role.
3. Examples of reasonable adjustments the Employer may consider include, but are not limited to:
    1. Offering flexible working arrangements (e.g. allowing Staff Members to start later to accommodate poor sleeping patterns).
    2. Allowing Staff Members to work from home, where practicable.
    3. Allowing flexibility for Staff Member uniforms or dress codes.
    4. Allowing flexibility around toilet breaks.
    5. Moving a Staff Member’s workstation to be close to windows that open.
    6. Providing a quiet break room for Staff Members to rest while experiencing menopausal symptoms while at work.
    7. X.

**Health and Safety and Risk Assessments**

1. Under applicable health and safety laws, the Employer has certain obligations and responsibilities. These include responsibilities to:
    1. Ensure the health, safety and welfare of its workforce; and
    2. Carry out health and safety risk assessments.
2. When carrying out health and safety risk assessments the Employer considers the specific needs of menopausal Staff Members, including their needs in relation to:
    1. Ventilation;
    2. Workplace temperature;
    3. Uniforms and dress codes;
    4. Access to toilet and washing facilities;
    5. Access to sanitary products;
    6. Access to drinking water;
    7. Workforce working times; and
    8. Workforce break times.
3. Staff Members should report any concerns about workplace health and safety to their line managers or the HR Department as soon as possible.

Mental Health is made up of our emotional, psychological and social well-being. The way we think, feel and act is based on all of these factors. A number stressors can contribute to a decline in mental health, from stress at work, social isolation to bereavement. That’s why at Wholegrain Digital, we think it is important to have easy access to helpful information when you need it most.

## Tips to promote a healthy mindset

- Start small – Give yourself small achievable targets to get yourself back into the swing of things. Whether it be work, a workout or just a general errand. Phone a friend – Sometimes debriefing about your day is all you need to put you back into a positive mindset\
- Try something New/Fun – Give yourself a new burst of motivation by doing something you’ve never done before
- Keep a journal – Getting the thoughts that are bothering you down on a page can help to clear them from your mind. Also writing down the things that we are grateful for in a day is important to see that not the whole day has been a bad day.
- Exercise regularly – Exercise releases endorphins. Endorphins are naturally produced by your nervous system and helps your deal with pain and stress.
- Eat Healthy – Research supports a diet of highly processed foods, with little nutrients, play a significant impact on not only your body but also your mind. Good nutrition allows you to feel good from the inside out.|
- Reflect – Making time to reflect is a powerful thing. Take time to reflect on the past day or week and reflect on how you resolved problems and how it felt. Reflection is a great way to stay in tune with yourself, learn and maintain a fresh mind.

**1.** **WRAP and Safeguarding**

WRAP’s direct contact with children and vulnerable adults is limited, being largely carried out and

supervised by partner employees: an example of our direct contact is our occasional work in the UK

with youth organisations such as the Scouts and Guides. Similarly, work with schools is through the

institution rather than child focussed, and, again, managed and overseen by individuals employed by

school authorities and DBS checked1 by them. Elsewhere, WRAP may come into contact with children

and vulnerable adults through its digital and social media campaigning work.

WRAP provides grants to more than 200 food redistribution organisations, some of which will directly

provide food to vulnerable people, while others will supply food to food banks and similar for

delivery. WRAP may also come into contact with children and vulnerable adults working with partners

under a service contract.

WRAP’s grants and international development teams are fully aware of their safeguarding

responsibilities. During the due diligence process partners are required to declare and demonstrate

they have a Safeguarding Children and Vulnerable Adults Policy and Procedures in place, share their

risk assessment approach and explain the relevant checks and assessments (including DBS or

equivalent checks) that they carry out. Compliance with all relevant regulations and government

guidelines on safeguarding is a contractual obligation; it is checked during contract negotiations and

communicated again within a grant welcome pack. WRAP maintains regular contact with grant

recipients throughout the contract period. Grant recipients and sub-contractors are required to report

back on all relevant compliance and risks matters, including safeguarding, health and safety and

environmental risks.

A commitment to the principles of safeguarding is integral to WRAP’s ethos. Just as its work is designed

to make the world a healthier, sustainable place, its Safeguarding Policy is designed to protect from

harm and keep safe its employees and vulnerable groups with whom it has contact through its work.

This includes developing, enabling, and nurturing a strong safeguarding culture within the

organisation.

Our work is guided and supported by a contemporary safeguarding policy base that is consistent with

professional best practice, which is compliant with the law and relevant regulations, and which reflects

the nature of our work and that of our partners. Our safeguarding framework comprises the following

three standards:

Standard 1:

Standard 2:

Safeguarding Policy which is supported by a Whistleblowing Policy and Code of

Conduct and Accountability Framework.

People and Partnerships which comprises, Safer Recruitment and Partner Due

Diligence.

Risk Management Policy and Risk Log.

Standard 3:

Through the implementation of our safeguarding framework, our intention is to promote the

development of a safeguarding culture that prioritises the safety and well-being of our partners and

their beneficiaries. The safety and well-being of our employees is managed through our human

resource management policies.

WRAP’s Safeguarding Policy applies to all its trustees, directors, its employees (full time or part time), consultants, service providers and, and all visitors, including journalists and associated personnel.

**2.** **WRAP Policy Statement**

WRAP’s Safeguarding Policy puts those we employ, our partners and the children and vulnerable

adults with whom we come into contact at the centre of all we do. WRAP works to the Charity

Commission’s description of the role of safeguarding, which is to “protect people who come into

contact with your charity through its work from abuse or mistreatment of any kind”.2

WRAP considers that **safeguarding** comprises safeguarding **by** staff/partners, safeguarding **of**

staff/partner staff and safeguarding **from** staff/partner’s staff. This policy relates to safeguarding of

children and vulnerable adults who come into contact with us through our work. The safeguarding of

staff/partner staff is managed through our human resource management policies.

Consequently, WRAP will:

●

Take all possible steps to safeguard and protect children and vulnerable adults who come into

contact with the activities of WRAP during its work, from abuse or mistreatment.

Safeguarding applies consistently and without exception across all areas of the organisation with

contact with children and vulnerable adults. It applies to **all** children and vulnerable adults regardless

of their background and requires proactively identifying, preventing, and guarding against all risks of

harm, exploitation and abuse. We commit to having robust, accountable, and transparent systems for

response, reporting and learning when safeguarding risks materialise. Those systems include a duty of

care to all actors to report incidents, allegations and concerns, and to adopt a survivor centred

approach3 to the alleged victim.

We require that our partners’ working practices represent a commitment to a safe, inclusive, and

nurturing safeguarding environment for all. When agreed as part of the due diligence process, WRAP

will assess its capacity to help partners develop policies consistent with these values.

We require employees to bring to WRAP’s attention through our safeguarding reporting system, any

concerns or allegations against any member of our staff team, partners and all people associated with

our work. WRAP commits to responding constructively and in a timely manner to reports or allegations

that are made to us.

WRAP’s policies are consistent with international instruments underpinning safeguarding work, with the United Kingdom’s national legal frameworks for the protection of children and vulnerable adults, and with the requirements and regulatory framework of the Charity Commission, specifically, “taking reasonable steps to protect from harm people who come into contact with your charity”.6

**6.**

Safer recruitment is an integral part of WRAP’s commitment to build an organisational culture wherein the safety and wellbeing of everyone involved is paramount. The overall purpose of safer recruitment is to help identify and deter or reject individuals who are deemed to pose a danger to children and vulnerable adults. Our safer recruitment policy states our procedures to reduce the risk of unsuitable people entering our organisation.

**Definitions**

**Legal Framework**

**Safer Recruitment**

**For the purpose of this policy:**

**Child:** Any person under the age of 184.

**Vulnerable adult:** Any person aged 18 or over who is or may need care and support, (e.g., health,

personal or social care), is experiencing or is at risk of abuse or neglect and because of this is unable

to protect themselves from either the risk or experience of neglect or abuse. Any beneficiary of our

partner organisations who is reliant on the services provided falls under this category.5

Further definitions with categories of abuse for children and vulnerable adults to be referred to when

assessing allegations of harm, and key terminology commonly associated with safeguarding can be

found in [Annex 1 - Additional Definitions**.**](https://wrap.org.uk/system/files/2022-11/Annex%201%20Additional%20Definitions.pdf)

**Code of Conduct**

WRAP has a [Code of Conduct](https://wrap.org.uk/system/files/2022-11/Code%20of%20Conduct%20-%20Employee%20Behaviour%20v8%20Nov%2021Final.pdf) that describes the ethics and behaviours required of all stakeholders to

ensure a robust safeguarding environment. It is designed to create a culture of safeguarding best

practice. All staff members, and all those who act on our behalf, will read and sign it, and are expected

to adhere to its values and minimum standards. Those making overseas visits are expected to uphold

WRAP understands that the Charity Commission will hold its trustees to account if it is found that it

did not follow the Charity Commission’s guidance and the law, or if it is found not to have taken

reasonable steps to protect from harm people who come into contact with the charity7.

WRAP trustees will promote a fair, open and positive culture and ensure all involved feel able to report

concerns, confident in the knowledge that they will be heard and responded to.

Safeguarding concerns may arise from recognition of potential signs of abuse, suspicion of harmful behaviours, and direct disclosure by a survivor.

We expect our partners to have their own Code of Conduct that clarifies the values, principles and the

acceptable behaviour within their organisations and which influences and drives their organisation’s

culture.

**8.** **Partner Selection and Due Diligence**

WRAP works with a range of partners in the corporate, statutory and voluntary (charity) sectors to

further its vision and mission.

WRAP requires all partners who come into contact with children and vulnerable adults to have and to

implement at a minimum a Safeguarding Policy, a Code of Conduct, a Whistleblowing Policy and Safer

Recruitment and Accountability Policy and to report all serious safeguarding incidents to us. Our

partner due diligence and selection policy can be accessed here. [(Partnership Due Diligence)](https://wrap.org.uk/system/files/2022-11/Partnership%20Due%20Diligence%20Document.pdf)

**9.** **Risk Management**

WRAP will manage risk responsibly. Risk is defined as uncertainty, whether positive or negative, that

will affect the outcome of an activity, or the well-being of individuals or the reputation of an

organisation. WRAP’s risk management log includes safeguarding risks. WRAP’s senior leadership team

is committed to review and assess regularly the risks faced by the organisation in all areas of our work

and to plan for the management of those risks.

**10.** **Whistleblowing**

WRAP’s Whistleblowing Policy allows concerns to be raised and resolved at the appropriate level. The

policy elaborates a clear process [(Whistleblowing Policy and Procedure)](https://wrap.org.uk/system/files/2022-11/Whistleblowing%20Policy%20FP01.pdf) that is widely understood and

accessible to all staff, for dealing with concerns and a handling framework with identified owners of

each step. The policy makes explicit that there can be no reprisals for the whistle blower where

concerns are reported in good faith and without malice. It identifies a clear process to follow if the

concern is being raised against an individual in the organisation who manages internal complaints or

concerns.

**11.** **Reporting and responding to concerns**

WRAP’s responsibility for recognising and reporting safeguarding concerns applies across the

organisation and with our partners. Designated staff are responsible for responding to safeguarding

concerns. Roles and responsibilities for staff and trustees with designated safeguarding responsibilities

and accountability lines can be seen in [**Annex 3 - Accountability Framework**.](https://wrap.org.uk/system/files/2022-11/Annex%203%20Accountability%20Framework%20%28003%29.pdf)

**11. WRAP’s procedure for responding to safeguarding concerns**

6

**11.1. Information sharing and data protection** WRAP will always seek and facilitate consent of alleged adult victims and children’s care givers before

sharing safeguarding concerns with the relevant authorities. However, in cases where information

suggests an immediate risk of harm, data protection legislation is not a barrier to sharing safeguarding

concerns. Those representing WRAP as staff cannot keep confidences when they involve concerns

about a vulnerable adult or a child who is at risk or likely risk of harm. It is important that everyone

providing services on behalf of WRAP is prepared to explain the limits of confidentiality.

**11.2. Reporting concerns relating to WRAP personnel**

All safeguarding concerns relating to WRAP staff/trustees must be reported to the Designated

Safeguarding Lead (DSL). If you are unsure whether a situation constitutes a safeguarding concern, you

are encouraged to contact the DSL to discuss it. When safeguarding issues are suspected, the person

to whom the concern has been reported must immediately inform the DSL. The reporting of suspected

or actual abuse is a professional and organisational obligation. Failure to report information can lead

to disciplinary action.

Your concern will be treated with respect and dealt with professionally. You can speak to the DSL face-

to-face where this is possible, electronically (Zoom, Teams, Email,) or by telephone. If you have

witnessed an incident, you may be asked to document the details in a written report. A template will

be provided to facilitate this. [(Safeguarding Incident Reporting Form)](https://wrap.org.uk/system/files/2022-11/WRAP%20Incident%20Reporting%20Form.pdf). If you are not able to do this,

the DSL will help you. The DSL will document the discussion and agreed actions. Depending on the

nature of the incident, s/he may make a report to the police, a referral to social care, and or file a

Serious Incident Report to the Charity Commission and inform donors.

WRAP takes all reports of safeguarding concerns seriously and will treat them confidentially. WRAP

aims to acknowledge all reported concerns within 24 hours. It will then respond according to the

severity of the incident. All serious incidents, as defined by the Charity Commission8, will be prioritised

for action.

**11.3. Reporting concerns identified through direct contact with children**

WRAP engages with children in school settings, and through specific groups such as guides and scouts.

Although these institutions and organisations have their own safeguarding policies and procedures, it

is important for WRAP to clarify roles and responsibilities. WRAP commits to the measures set out in

the ‘Safeguarding checklist for Engaging with Schools, Guides and Scouts’, [**Annex 5 - Checklist for**](https://wrap.org.uk/system/files/2022-11/Annex%205%20Checklist%20for%20engaging%20with%20organisations%20working%20with%20children.pdf)

[**Engaging with Organisations**.](https://wrap.org.uk/system/files/2022-11/Annex%205%20Checklist%20for%20engaging%20with%20organisations%20working%20with%20children.pdf)

**11.4. Reporting concerns in partner organisations**

Partners will be required to report serious safeguarding incidents through WRAP’s serious incident

reporting form [(Partner Serious Incident Reporting Form)](https://wrap.org.uk/system/files/2022-11/WRAP%20-%20Partner%20Serious%20incident%20Reporting%20Form.pdf). A report from a partner should include the

actions that are being taken to act on the concern raised. Allegations of inappropriate behaviour

between WRAP staff and partner staff/volunteers will be managed through WRAP’s HR management

processes. Allegations of inappropriate behaviour between partner staff and volunteers/beneficiaries

will be managed by the partner organisation. Support can be sought from WRAP who will comment,

and advise where necessary, on any steps being taken by the partner organisation. Should the concern

be connected to an allegation of harm, abuse or exploitation by the manager or coordinator of one of

our partner organisations, WRAP will consider its capacity to support the partner’s governing body to

Where partners do not demonstrate a commitment to WRAP’s minimum safeguarding compliance requirements, we will engage with the partner to resolve the situation through negotiation.

If the partner remains high risk in relation to safeguarding, WRAP will take steps to terminate the

partnership. Such actions will only be taken after careful consideration of all relevant consequences

by the senior management team.

The DSL will present the results from the incident investigation and other relevant information, along

with a recommendation for action to the trustee board via the CEO and Safeguarding Lead Trustee.

**13. Recording**

All concerns or allegations must be recorded as soon as possible, and the record will form the basis for sharing information with the DSL and onward referral.

Records will be kept in line with Data Protection requirements and information will be shared

observing GDPR requirements. All incident reports will be clearly recorded with concerns raised and

actions taken and securely stored with password protected access.

**14. Media and Communications**

Through its use of photographs, video and written case study material, WRAP commits to representing information about its partners and beneficiaries in ways that respect the dignity of the people portrayed. WRAP respects the wishes of the individual when requesting permission for photographs/video/and written information.

Informed consent must be obtained by anyone whose photograph/video/case information will be

used for the purpose of communicating WRAP’s work. WRAP will not take photograph of anyone who

is concerned about the use or impact of the image. Consent must be provided by the parent or

guardian for children under the age of 18.

manage the investigation as appropriate to the situation. Decisions about suspending funding will be made following a risk assessment of the partner organisation. If it is felt that the situation has not been dealt with in line with the severity of the incident, WRAP will advise on the next steps and, if appropriate, report to the relevant authorities. The intention is to do this sensitively, in a non- judgemental manner and with the best interests of the people we support at the centre of decision- making processes.

A standardised flowchart on reporting safeguarding concerns will be laminated and displayed at

WRAP’s Head Office. Partners who have contact with children and vulnerable adults are expected to

develop and communicate clear reporting pathways to their staff and those with whom they have

contact to ensure that reporting mechanisms are fully understood by those that they work with.

Likewise, for an adult who lacks the capacity to provide informed consent, a family member/care giver

must give consent on their behalf. [(Consent Form - All Media Types)](https://wrap.org.uk/system/files/2022-11/Consent%20Form-%20All%20Media%20Types.pdf)

The quality of consent obtained is essential. If there is a real or perceived imbalance of power between

photographer and the person being photographed, gaining true consent may not be possible. It is

often the case that people receiving services or benefits find it difficult to refuse a request to be

The safe and responsible use of technology is an important consideration at WRAP. Our E-safety arrangements apply to the use of the internet and other means of communication using electronic media (e.g., text messages, gaming devices, email etc). WRAP has measures in place to ensure that confidential material transmitted electronically is encrypted so that it cannot be viewed “in flight”, and that all email arriving or leaving WRAP can be traced to ensure it has been delivered successfully. WRAP has an ‘Acceptable Use’ Policy [(Acceptable Use Policy for WRAP IT Systems)](https://wrap.org.uk/system/files/2022-11/Acceptable%20Use%20Policy%20for%20WRAP%20IT%20Systems%20C10.pdf) that all staff are required to read and sign as part of on-boarding. This policy also outlines WRAP’s data security processes and includes a specific code of conduct which sets out expected standards of behaviour

photographed. It is good practice to ensure that the subject of the photograph/video/case study understands how, when and where the information is going to be used and where it will be stored and for how long. Absolutely no payments or any other form of compensation are to be provided to any person being photographed/videoed in exchange for their video film or photograph or to encourage consent.

WRAP understands that in today’s digital landscape, photographs can be shared widely beyond their

original intent of use. Consequently, we work hard to ensure that individuals who have their

photographs taken in relation to our work are used for the purpose for which consent is given. We will

ensure that people who give us consent have clear pathways for contacting us through our

communication and media teams and that they are aware that options to withdraw consent remain

open, without a time limit.

When using photographs, video film or case study material the names of children will always be

changed to protect their identity. WRAP’s media and communication team will ensure that no

photographs/videos of children or vulnerable adults will be used that could be regarded as degrading

or sexually provocative. Photographs of children or vulnerable adults that are partially clothed or

naked will neither be taken nor used. Photographs or videos will not be manipulated or taken out of

context.

WRAP will ensure that any photograph or recorded case study history of a child or vulnerable adult

does not place them in a position of harm or render them vulnerable to any form of exploitation or

abuse. WRAP will disguise their identity and will not provide any information that could lead to a child

or vulnerable adult being identified or tracked.

All social media and case studies used through digital channels generated by WRAP will be subject to

the same safeguarding guidelines as outlined in this policy. [Social Media Guidelines](https://wrap.org.uk/system/files/2022-11/Social%20Media%20Policy%20M01.pdf) must be followed

at all times. Information about a child/children or vulnerable adult’s life and any photographs/videos

of children or vulnerable adults will be kept confidential in secure files. Access to photographs is

limited to those that need them during the course of their work.

**15. Working with news and communications media.**

WRAP works with media around the world every day to provide briefings, commentary, the latest data,

opinions, insights, and evidence of what works – and why. Please contact us for more information on

online. Staff are regularly updated and sent reminders about E-Safety issues through our internal channels.

Our servers also have a firewall in place to detect and mitigate cyber security threats and we have

systems in place that continually monitor our e-safety arrangements.

WRAP’s suite of safeguarding policies will be available to all staff via The HUB and to the wider public via its external website.

All staff will sign the code of conduct as part of the induction process; Head of Commercial will ensure

that all partners and contractors receive a copy and comply, particularly for high-risk activities.

WRAP employees with specific safeguarding responsibilities will be trained to receive and respond

professionally to safeguarding concerns and allegations.

All our partners will be informed about our requirements in relation to safeguarding arrangements

that must in be in place to safeguard children and vulnerable adults that they come in contact with

through their work.

Safeguarding will be integrated in our monitoring and evaluation activities.

The Designated Safeguarding Lead, together with the HR Director, will contribute to the quarterly

trustee board meetings summarising safeguarding activity, analysing safeguarding data and trends,

and identifying any key areas for improvement.

WRAP will continually evaluate its safeguarding practice and update its policy following an annual

review by DSL/Head of Commercial.

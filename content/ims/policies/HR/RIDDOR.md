## Introduction to RIDDOR

RIDDOR (Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations) is a UK health and safety legislation that requires employers, self-employed people and those in control of premises to report specified workplace incidents.

## What Must Be Reported?

- Deaths and specified injuries
- Occupational diseases
- Dangerous occurrences (near-miss incidents)
- Gas incidents
- Over-seven-day incapacitation of a worker

## Reporting Timeframes

Different types of reportable incidents have different timeframes:

- Fatal and specified injuries: Report without delay (maximum 10 days)
- Over-seven-day injuries: Report within 15 days
- Occupational diseases: Report as soon as received diagnosis

## How to Report

Reports should be submitted to the HSE (Health and Safety Executive) through their online reporting system. Only specified responsible persons should submit reports.

## Record Keeping

Organizations must maintain records of all RIDDOR-reportable incidents for at least three years from the date of reporting.

Important: Failure to report incidents under RIDDOR is a criminal offense and can result in prosecution.

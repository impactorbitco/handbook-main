### Introduction

At Impact Orbit Creative Group, we value attendance and punctuality as essential components of a productive and cohesive work environment. Our Attendance Management Policy outlines our expectations regarding attendance, tardiness, and leave procedures to ensure the smooth operation of our business and the fair treatment of all employees.

### Policy Statement

1. **Attendance Expectations**: All employees are expected to report to work on time and fulfil their assigned work hours as scheduled. Regular attendance is critical to the success of our organisation and contributes to our overall productivity and success.
2. **Punctuality**: Employees are expected to arrive at work and return from breaks and lunch within the designated times outlined in their work schedules. Habitual tardiness or unauthorized absences may result in disciplinary action.
3. **Communication**: In the event of unexpected absences or tardiness, employees must notify their immediate supervisor or the Human Resources department as soon as possible. Failure to communicate absences may result in disciplinary action.
4. **Leave Requests**: Employees must adhere to the company's leave request procedures when requesting time off for vacation, personal reasons, medical appointments, or other reasons. Leave requests should be submitted in advance whenever possible, except in cases of emergency.
5. **Documentation**: Employees may be required to provide documentation, such as a doctor's note or other supporting evidence, for absences due to illness or medical appointments. Failure to provide documentation may result in the absence being considered unauthorized.
6. **Flexible Work Arrangements**: Impact Orbit Creative Group may offer flexible work arrangements, such as remote work or flexible hours, to accommodate employees' needs and promote work-life balance. However, employees must adhere to the agreed-upon schedule and meet their work obligations.

### Responsibilities

1. **Employee Responsibilities**:
    - Employees are responsible for maintaining regular attendance and punctuality.
    - Employees must communicate any absences or tardiness to their supervisor or HR in a timely manner.
    - Employees must follow the company's leave request procedures and provide necessary documentation for absences.
2. **Manager and Supervisor Responsibilities**:
    - Managers and supervisors are responsible for monitoring employee attendance and addressing any attendance issues promptly and fairly.
    - Managers should provide support and guidance to employees who may be experiencing attendance challenges and work with them to find solutions.
3. **Human Resources Responsibilities**:
    - HR will oversee the administration of the Attendance Management Policy and provide guidance to employees and managers as needed.
    - HR will maintain records of employee attendance, absences, and leave requests in accordance with company policies and legal requirements.

### Consequences

1. **Disciplinary Action**: Employees who fail to meet attendance expectations or violate the Attendance Management Policy may be subject to disciplinary action, including verbal warnings, written warnings, suspension, or termination of employment, depending on the severity of the offense and the employee's history of attendance-related issues.
2. **Support and Assistance**: Employees who are experiencing challenges with attendance may be offered support and assistance through counseling, coaching, or other resources to help them improve their attendance and address any underlying issues affecting their attendance.

### Conclusion

Impact Orbit Creative Group is committed to promoting a culture of attendance and accountability among all employees. By adhering to the guidelines outlined in this policy, we aim to maintain a productive and efficient work environment while supporting the well-being and success of our employees.

# **Attendance Policy**

In our quest for a happy, healthy team, we encourage all our team members to maximise your attendance at work, whether in the office or working from home. We fully understand that a certain level of absence is inevitable for a variety of reasons, including [sickness](https://www.wholegraindigital.com/granary/post/sickness-return-work).

However, if you’re frequently absent from work or are absent for a lengthy period, this can damage our efficiency and productivity, and place an additional burden on the rest of the team.

For that reason, we operate an attendance policy with the aim of striking a reasonable balance between our business needs and your personal needs. The aim of this policy is to encourage reliable attendance so we can run a well-balanced team.

For the purpose of this policy, all employee absences are counted except for approved holidays, family leave periods, approved compassionate leave, pregnancy-related absences, absences resulting from a workplace accident, and absences related to an employee disability (unless it’s justifiable to include them).

Application of this policy is completely separate from the disciplinary procedure. It doesn’t mean that you’ve done or are doing anything wrong.

# **Attendance Procedure**

Our attendance procedure has three stages. At each stage, there’s a ‘trigger point’ relating to the amount of time you’ve been absent from work. When you reach a trigger point, the Directors may interview you and, depending on the circumstances, might issue a warning about unsatisfactory attendance.

**Stage one:** Stage one is activated when you’ve been absent from work for 10 working days in any 12-month period.

We’ll hold an attendance review meeting with one of the Directors to discuss the reasons for your poor attendance. If we’re unsatisfied with the outcome of this meeting, we’ll issue a first written warning for unsatisfactory attendance.

If your level of attendance improves in the following 12 months, you’ll be removed from this procedure.

**Stage two:** Stage two is activated if you’re absent from work for 8 working days in the 12-month period following stage one.

We’ll hold a second attendance review meeting, which could result in a second written warning.

If your attendance improves during the following 12 months, you’ll drop back to stage one for the next 12 months.

**Stage three:** Stage three is a repeat of the second stage – 8 days absence in the 12 months following our second review meeting. This could result in the employee’s dismissal, unless there are exceptional mitigating circumstances.

We understand that there are sometimes reasons for absence that are beyond your control (for example, compassionate leave). Should this be the case, we’ll still invite you to a meeting to see what’s going on and whether you need any additional support, but we wouldn’t issue a written warning. If you’ve reached stage three, we will take this into consideration before deciding whether you’ll be dismissed.

We keep a written record of the key points discussed in the meeting and the final outcome, and you’ll have a copy for your records.

The People Manager, is responsible for implementing and monitoring this policy.

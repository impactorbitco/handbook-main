**1. Introduction**

At Impact Orbit Creative Group, we value the well-being and work-life balance of our employees. We understand that everyone has unique scheduling needs and responsibilities outside of work. Therefore, we offer a flexitime policy to provide flexibility in work hours while ensuring that business needs are met.

**2. Eligibility**

All full-time employees of Impact Orbit Creative Group are eligible to participate in the flexitime program. Part-time employees may also be considered for flexible working arrangements based on their role and workload.

**3. Core Hours**

While employees have flexibility in their work schedules, there are core hours during which they are expected to be available for meetings, collaboration, and communication. The core hours for Impact Orbit Creative Group are from 10:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. Employees are required to be present or accessible during these core hours unless otherwise agreed upon with their supervisor.

**4. Flexitime Arrangements**

Flexitime arrangements allow employees to adjust their start and end times, as long as they complete their required hours and fulfill their job responsibilities. Employees may also have the option to work remotely, subject to approval by their supervisor and the nature of their role.

**5. Requesting Flexitime**

Employees interested in participating in the flexitime program must submit a written request to their supervisor or manager. The request should include the proposed flexible schedule, reasons for the request, and how the employee plans to maintain productivity.

**6. Supervisor Approval**

Supervisors or managers will review flexitime requests on a case-by-case basis, considering operational needs, team collaboration, and workload distribution. Approval of flexitime arrangements is at the discretion of the supervisor, with the best interests of the employee and the company in mind.

**7. Trial Period**

In some cases, flexitime arrangements may be implemented on a trial basis to evaluate their feasibility and impact on productivity. During the trial period, both the employee and the company will assess the effectiveness of the flexible working arrangement and make adjustments as needed.

**8. Performance Expectations**

Employees participating in the flexitime program are expected to maintain their performance standards and meet deadlines. Supervisors will monitor performance regularly and provide feedback as needed. Adjustments to flexitime arrangements may be made if performance standards are not met.

**9. Communication and Collaboration**

Employees engaged in flexitime arrangements are responsible for maintaining open communication with their supervisors and team members. They should ensure accessibility during core hours and actively collaborate with colleagues to achieve team goals.

**10. Compliance with Policies**

Employees participating in the flexitime program must adhere to all company policies and procedures, including those related to attendance, timekeeping, confidentiality, and data security.

**11. Review and Evaluation**

This flexitime policy will be reviewed periodically to assess its effectiveness and make any necessary updates. Feedback from employees and supervisors will be considered in the review process to ensure that the policy continues to support the needs of our workforce.

**12. Approval**

This flexitime policy has been approved by the management of Impact Orbit Creative Group and is effective as of [Effective Date]. All employees are expected to familiarize themselves with the policy and comply with its guidelines.

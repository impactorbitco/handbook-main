# Impact Orbit Creative Group  
## Whistleblowing Policy

---

## 1. Policy Statement

Impact Orbit Creative Group is committed to promoting a culture of openness, integrity, and transparency across all its activities. We recognise that effective and honest communication is essential to identifying and addressing concerns about wrongdoing, breaches, or failures, and to ensuring the long-term success and credibility of the organisation.

This policy provides guidance to anyone who works for, with, or on behalf of Impact Orbit Creative Group and who may, from time to time, feel the need to raise concerns in confidence.

Any worker who raises a genuine concern in the public interest under this policy will not be subjected to any detriment, disadvantage, harassment, or victimisation as a result of doing so.

---

### 1.1 Objective

The purpose of this policy is to empower and encourage staff and associated individuals to report concerns responsibly and safely. It recognises the legal rights of workers to make protected disclosures under whistleblowing legislation and supports a transparent, ethical workplace culture.

---

### 1.2 Commitment to Prevention

Impact Orbit Creative Group is committed to preventing, identifying, and addressing fraud, misconduct, and wrongdoing. All concerns raised will be taken seriously, investigated promptly, and handled consistently and fairly.

---

### 1.3 Training and Induction

- Managers receive regular refresher training to ensure they are confident in handling whistleblowing concerns.
- New employees, supervisors, and managers are introduced to this policy during induction.
- Training includes awareness of whistleblowing law and how to use this policy appropriately.

---

### 1.4 Resources and Accessibility

- Adequate resources are allocated to support the effective implementation of this policy.
- The policy is widely promoted and accessible via company documentation and internal systems.
- Staff are encouraged to familiarise themselves with the policy and how to use it.

---

### 1.5 Protection from Retaliation

Impact Orbit Creative Group will not tolerate retaliation of any kind against individuals who raise concerns in good faith. Where a whistleblower is dissatisfied with the response received, they are encouraged to escalate the matter further in line with this policy.

---

## 2. Definitions and Scope

This policy applies to:

- All employees (permanent, temporary, casual, agency)
- Contractors and consultants
- Volunteers and work experience placements
- Apprentices, trainees, and learners
- Self-employed individuals working on behalf of the organisation
- Former workers, where relevant

For the purposes of this policy, whistleblowing is defined as the disclosure of information about wrongdoing at work where the individual reasonably believes they are acting in the public interest.

---

### 2.1 Categories of Wrongdoing

Statutory categories of wrongdoing include:

- Criminal offences (e.g. fraud, bribery, tax evasion)
- Breaches of legal obligations
- Miscarriages of justice
- Endangering health and safety
- Environmental damage
- Deliberate concealment of any of the above

---

### 2.2 Examples of Wrongdoing

Examples may include (but are not limited to):

- Unsafe working conditions  
- Failure to respond appropriately to safety incidents  
- Inadequate induction or training  
- Suspected fraud or financial misconduct  
- A systemic bullying or toxic culture  
- Safeguarding concerns  

Proof is not required to raise a concern. A reasonable belief is sufficient. Responsibility for investigation rests with the organisation, not the individual raising the concern.

---

### 2.3 Protection and Confidentiality

- Individuals making protected disclosures have the right not to be dismissed, victimised, or subjected to detriment.
- Confidentiality will be maintained wherever possible.
- Any confidentiality or non-disclosure clauses do not prevent disclosures made in the public interest and are void in such circumstances.

---

### 2.4 Reporting Other Concerns

Concerns that relate solely to an individual’s personal employment situation (e.g. terms and conditions) should normally be raised through the grievance or dignity at work procedures instead of this policy.

---

### 2.5 Review and Consultation

This policy is reviewed annually by the designated officers in conjunction with senior management. Where legislative or regulatory changes occur, the policy will be reviewed immediately.

---

## 3. Roles and Responsibilities

---

### 3.2 All Staff

All staff have a responsibility to report wrongdoing where appropriate, understand this policy, and act in accordance with it.

---

### 3.3 Line Managers

Line managers are responsible for:

- Investigating concerns promptly and fairly  
- Fostering an open and supportive culture

---

### 3.4 Designated Officers

- Investigate concerns raised directly with them

- Ensure feedback is provided on progress and outcomes

---

## 5. How to Raise a Concern

Concerns can be raised:

- Informally or formally with a line manager  
- Directly with a designated officer  
- In writing (email or letter), setting out background, dates, and reasons  

If a concern involves a line manager or is not resolved, staff should contact a designated officer directly.

---

### 5.1 Confidential and Anonymous Disclosures

- Concerns can be raised confidentially; this should be stated at the outset.
- Anonymous disclosures are accepted but may limit feedback or investigation effectiveness.
- Identity will not be disclosed without consent unless legally required.

- How and by whom it will be investigated  
- Expected timescales and next steps  

---

### 6.1 Investigation and Outcomes

- Investigations will be evidence-based and proportionate.
- Findings will focus on resolution and organisational learning.
- Disciplinary action may follow where misconduct is identified.
- Where possible, outcomes and actions taken will be shared with the whistleblower.

If an individual is dissatisfied with the response, they may escalate the matter to senior management for further review.

---

## 7. Harassment and Victimisation

Impact Orbit Creative Group will not tolerate:

- Harassment or victimisation of whistleblowers  
- Attempts to discourage or silence individuals raising concerns  

Such behaviour is a serious breach of organisational values and may result in disciplinary action, including dismissal.

If a concern is raised in good faith but not upheld, no action will be taken against the individual.

---

## 8. Reporting to External Bodies

While internal reporting is encouraged, individuals may raise concerns externally where appropriate and in the public interest, including with prescribed regulators or their Member of Parliament.

A full list of prescribed persons and bodies is available via the UK Government website.

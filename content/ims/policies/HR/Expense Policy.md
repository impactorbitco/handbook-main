Global Travel and Expense Policy | The GitLab Handbook

[https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/finance/expenses/](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/finance/expenses/)

GitLab’s Global Travel & Expense Policy is meant to provide guidance to all Team Members to ensure that we act in the best interest of our Company at all times. The purpose of this policy is to:

**Team Members**:

**Managers and/or Budget Owners**:

**Accounting**:

**Finance**:

**Payment method**

**Following expenses are categorized for reimbursement purposes with specific policy definition attached to it. The limits below are in USD, please use local currency equivalents when considering other currencies.**

All business related flights need to be booked through Navan, and will be paid by GitLab travel card. For each flight search, Navan determines the price in real time. Also to note that while it is sometimes possible to find a cheaper flight outside of Navan, we get overall better rates in the aggregate with the buying power of the whole company. Even if a flight is cheaper outside of Navan, please book in Navan. Also submit a request under the `Expenses -> Travel Related Expenses` page of [HelpLab](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/enterprise-applications/guides/helplab-guide/) with screenshots of Navan’s rate and the other airlines rate so the Expense team can address with Navan.

The airfare policy in Navan is set up as a “Dynamic Policy” which calculates a fair market price for every search based on travel dates and destinations. Any purchases that are over 20% of the Dynamic Policy will be flagged for further review by your manager. Also note that anything booked outside of Navan will flag as “Out of Policy”, and will need to be reviewed by your manager and the AP team.

**A. Third Party Liability**

Purchase the liability insurance that is excess of the standard inclusion of State minimum coverage in the rental agreement at the rental agency. GitLab’s insurance policy provides liability insurance for rental cars while conducting company business, but it may be excess over any underlying liability coverage through the driver or credit card company used to purchase the rental.

Purchase the liability offered at the rental counter if there are Non-US Team Members renting autos in the US or Canada. While workers’ compensation would protect an injured US Team Member, other passengers may have the right to sue. To ensure that GitLab has protection when a Non-US Team Member invites another person into the car we recommend the purchase of this insurance when offered at the rental counter.

**B. Physical Damage - Collision Damage Waiver**

Do Not purchase the Collision Damage Waiver offered at the rental counter. GitLab purchases coverage for damage to rented vehicles. If travel to Mexico is required, purchase the liability insurance for Mexico offered at the rental counter. You should verify that the rental agreement clearly states that the vehicle may be driven into Mexico and liability coverage will apply.

Countries other than the US and Canada:

In the event of an accident resulting in damage to the rental car, the Non-US rental agency will charge the credit card used to make the reservation with an estimated amount of repair costs if insurance is not purchased. If this happens, GitLab does not purchase Foreign Corporate Hired Auto Physical Damage Coverage to reimburse for damages.

The company will cover all work-related travel expenses. This includes lodging and meals during the part of the trip that is work-related. Depending on the distance of your travel, it can also include one day before and one day after the work related business. For example, if you are attending a 3 day conference in a jet lag-inducing location, the company will cover your lodging and meals those 3 days as well as one day before and one day after.

If a Team Member is missing a receipt, a Missing Receipt Affidavit will need to be completed and attached to the expense when submitted. Missing Receipt Affidavit located [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/179q0Wos-CemLCe1uxgMpZ80JukSC4KYx8JICFgHzN0I/edit?usp=sharing) (please ensure to make a copy). When attaching the receipt affidavit, the Team Member should attach the document as a PDF.

The procedure by which reimbursable expenses are processed varies and is dependent on contributor legal status (e.g. independent contractor, Team Member) and subsidiary assignment.

**Navan Purchase Card**

These virtual cards within Navan are only utilized by the AP team, and they are used solely for providing new Team Members with a $1,500 USD (or local currency equivalent) stipend for their home office set up. These cards were set up to ensure that Team Members do not spend outside of this amount, as well as ensuring the stipend is only available during their first year of employment. Within the controls in Navan, these cards are only accessible to the AP Admins team, and are not accessible to Team Members.

Below is some more information to help you get set up with your [Navan](https://navan.com/) account.

This policy applies to all GitLab team members registering, or maintaining a registration for, GitLab-related Domain Names, including GitLab-related Domain Names registered or used for sandbox or testing purposes.

Domain names are key assets in GitLab’s intellectual property portfolio. Centralizing the registration and maintainance of domain names under the Infrastructure Shared Services group using GitLab’s approved domain name registrar helps us track and protect these valuable assets. Please refer to the [Domain Names and DNS Records Handbook Page](https://internal.gitlab.com/handbook/it/it-self-service/it-guides/domains-dns/).

**“GitLab-related Domain Names”** when used in this policy means any domain name:

This relates To Laptop Advances only - If more information is required please email the AP team on [AP@gitlab.com](mailto:AP@gitlab.com)

If a team member whom you manage has left GitLab and comes to you with final expenses that are valid for reimbursement, please verify that they were not already processed in Navan and then contact Accounts Payable. You must submit valid receipts and a completed copy of the [Expense Reimbursement template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TiSbp1C3-7WERqDanfBKTxdm5VevQ5QDOAiI_GaizBg/edit#gid=1450348181) along with your approval. Please note that we may also ask the terminated team member to provide valid banking details in order to process the payment to them.

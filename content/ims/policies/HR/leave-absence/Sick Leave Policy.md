Team members are entitled to Statutory Sick Pay (“SSP”)for up to 28 weeks, to be paid by GitLab. SSP is paid when a team member is sick for at least 4 days in a row (including non-working days); however, team members are not entitled to SSP for the first three “waiting” days.

- A team member who is out sick for at least four days, but no more than 7 days will need to complete a [Company Self-Certification Form](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Cy-xUgWwNKroUEEJ0ut80HGVA0d3RJV5mQO-amLjoCs/edit?usp=sharing) and return it to [leaves@gitlab.com](mailto:leaves@gitlab.com).
- Team members who will be out sick for more than 7 days must provide a [fit note](https://www.gov.uk/taking-sick-leave) and notify the Absence Management team at `leaves@gitlab.com` as soon as possible.
- Team members who have received SSP in the last 8 weeks who need additional sick pay will be paid for waiting days, including the initial 3-day period of the second leave.
- Sick Leave runs concurrently with GitLab PTO. Team members must designate any time off for illness as `Out Sick` in Workday to ensure that annual sick leave entitlement is properly tracked. GitLab PTO is inclusive of any entitlement in respect of statutory sick pay.

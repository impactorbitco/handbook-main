The following leave types run concurrently with GitLab PTO. Team members should initiate leave by selecting the appropriate option in `Workday`. If none applies, the team members should notify their manager and the Absence Management team `leaves@gitlab.com` to initiate leave.

**Carer’s Leave:** Team members are entitled to at least one week of unpaid leave (pro-rated) each year to provide or arrange care for a dependent with a long-term care need.

**Magistrate Duty:** Any team member who is a magistrate is entitled to leave to carry out their duties. Magistrates will need to be in court for at least 13 days or 26 half-days per year.

**Justice of the Peace (Scotland):** Any team member who is a Justice of the Peace is entitled to leave to carry out their duties.

**Jury Service:** Team members who are called for jury service are entitled to time off to complete the service. Jury Service usually lasts up to 10 days, but can last longer.

**Parental Bereavement Leave:** Team members are entitled to 2 weeks of leave for a child under 18 who has died or if the team member has a stillbirth after 24 weeks of pregnancy.

**Time off for Public Duties:** Team members are entitled to a reasonable amount of time off if they are a local councillor, a school governor, a member of any statutory tribunal, a member of the managing or governing body of an educational establishment, a member of a health authority, a member of a school council or board in Scotland, a member of the Environment Agency or the Scottish Environment Protection agency, a member of the prison independent monitoring boards (England or Wales) or a member of the prison visiting committees (Scotland), a member of Scottish Water or a Water Customer Consultation Panel, or a trade union member. The amount of time should be agreed upon between the team member and the manager beforehand based on how long the duties might take, the amount of time the team member has already taken off for public duties, and how the time off will affect the business.

**Statement and Purpose of Policy**

1. __________ is committed to enabling employees to perform any jury service that you may be obliged to undertake and so will allow you time off to do so where it does not conflict with the operational needs of the business.
2. This Policy only applies to employees. It does not apply to agency workers or self-employed contractors.
3. No employee will be penalised or subjected to any detriment for asking for, or taking, time off work to attend jury service.
4. This Policy does not form part of any employee's contract of employment and we reserve the right to amend this Policy at any time.
5. Any abuse of the right to time off for jury service will be regarded as serious misconduct and may lead to disciplinary action against the employee.
6. If you have any questions about time off for public duties, please refer them to your line manager.

**Procedure Before Jury Service Begins**

1. If you are called for jury service you must let your line manager and the HR department know at the earliest opportunity.
2. You must provide a copy of your jury summons/citation to enable us to make arrangements whilst you are away and to understand the amount of time you'll need off. We will hold a copy of this jury summons/citation on file.
3. Jury service typically lasts for 10 days. If your jury service is expected to last longer, you will be notified by the courts and you must inform us.
4. Your manager will then consult affected teams or departments to discuss arrangements that need to be made.
5. In the event that your absence for jury service would severely impact or disrupt the business, we may ask you to submit a request to the court to defer jury service (or a request for excusal from jury service, if you are based in Scotland).
6. If we require you to defer or apply for excusal from jury service, we will provide a supporting letter outlining the reasons why we are requesting that you defer or apply for excusal from jury service. Where we consider that this applies, you should not submit an application for excusal or deferral before we have provided you with a letter (and any other relevant evidence) to support the application. We will provide a supporting letter (and any other relevant evidence) within 48 hours of you notifying us.
7. If your jury service is deferred or you have been excused, we will work with you to allocate time in the future to attend jury service.
8. If we do not require you to defer or apply for excusal from jury service, we will grant you the necessary amount of time off work to perform jury service.

**Pay**

1. Time off for jury service will be paid at your normal rate of pay, subject to any tax deductions. This means you will not be eligible to claim for loss of earnings through the court.

**Returning to Work**

1. If your services are not required for any part or the whole of a court day you will be expected to return to work for the remainder of the working day.
2. If your jury service ends before the expected 10-day period (or such longer period as the court may have indicated to you that you will be required for) you will be expected to return to work for the remainder of that period.

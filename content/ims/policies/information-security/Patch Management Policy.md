# Patch Management Policy

## Overview

This document outlines the policy for managing and applying patches to systems and software in compliance with ISO/IEC 27001 standards for Information Security Management. It is classified as a strategic Level 1 policy and forms part of the organization's commitment to maintaining a secure and resilient IT infrastructure.

## Purpose

Effective patch management is a critical component of the organization's Information Security Management System (ISMS).

This policy applies to all systems, software, and devices used within the organization. It includes operating systems, applications, and any third-party tools that require updates or patches to address security vulnerabilities. All employees, contractors, and third-party vendors are required to comply with this policy.

## Policy Details

### 1. Patch Management Process

- **Identification:** The IT team will monitor for available patches or updates from trusted vendors and sources.
- **Assessment:** Each identified patch will be assessed for relevance, urgency, and potential impact on existing systems.
- **Testing:** Before deployment, patches will be tested in a controlled environment to ensure compatibility and minimize disruptions.
- **Deployment:** Approved patches will be deployed to production systems in a timely manner based on their priority.

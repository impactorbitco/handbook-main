### **Global Accessibility Definition**

Accessibility refers to the design of environments, systems, products, and services so that they can be used by all people — regardless of disability or difference — without the need for adaptation.

**Standard Equipment and Accommodations Framework**

**Standard Equipment:** Available to all team members. This includes ergonomic equipment, adjustable desks, and a standard home office setup accessed through regular processes and budgets. Individualized workplace modifications beyond standard equipment offerings may be provided as a reasonable accommodation/adjustment (see definition below) in accordance with applicable law.

### **Global Reasonable Accommodation/Adjustment Definition**

A reasonable accommodation (or reasonable adjustment) refers to any change or modification made to the work environment, job duties, or application process that enables a qualified individual with a disability to perform the essential functions of their job.

These accommodations are implemented unless they would:

- Create an undue hardship or disproportionate burden for the company
- Pose a direct threat to health or safety
- Conflict with local legal requirements

*Note: Specific legal standards for reasonableness vary by country. Please consult with your Team Member Relations Partner for any country-specific queries.*

**Global Undue Hardship Definition**

An accommodation request would create an undue hardship (or disproportionate burden) if it would:

- Require significant difficulty or expense that is disproportionate to GitLab’s available resources
- Significantly change the core way we operate as a remote-first organization
- Create legal challenges that are extremely difficult to manage across multiple countries and jurisdictions

This assessment is made through a partnership between the team member, their manager, People Business Partners, Team Member Relations, and Legal, considering the specific essential functions of the role and departmental context.

### **Team Members Requesting Accommodations**

Please submit your request for an accommodation by submitting a ticket in HelpLab. Your answers will be viewed only by the Team Member Relations Team (TMR), and only the requested accommodation(s) will be shared with your Manager/PBP as needed.

Team Members are under no obligation to provide GitLab with a diagnosis, but you may be asked questions related to how your condition impacts your ability to perform the essential functions of your job, in accordance with applicable law. The TMR will provide you with any necessary paperwork, and assist you with your request.

**Equipment Procurement:** Any specialized equipment or technology beyond GitLab’s standard offerings requires pre-approval before purchase. Equipment purchased without prior approval may not be reimbursed. All requests can be submitted by opening an Accommodations ticket via HelpLab.

**Applicants Requesting Accommodations** The Talent Aquisition team should contact the Team Member Relations team (TMR) if a candidate requests an accommodation during the interview process. The TMR team will reach out to the candidate directly if more information is needed. Applicants are under no obligation to provide GitLab with a diagnosis, but you may be asked questions related to how your condition impacts your ability to interview for the role, in accordance with applicable law.

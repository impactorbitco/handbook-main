- Users must ensure that their devices are updated with the latest security patches and antivirus software.

### 3. Device Security

- Logs will be retained in compliance with the organization's data retention policies.

### 5. User Responsibilities

- Users must report any security incidents or suspected breaches immediately to the Security Management team.

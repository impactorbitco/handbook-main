At Impact Orbit Creative Group, we recognize the critical importance of information governance and data security in safeguarding the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of both company and client data. This policy outlines the measures and protocols in place to manage, protect, and govern data effectively.

## 2. Data Management

### 2.1 Responsibility
All employees share responsibility for data management. The Chief Information Officer (CIO) is the primary overseer of data governance and security initiatives.

### 2.2 Data Ownership
Each department is responsible for the data it collects, processes, and maintains. Department heads ensure that data under their control is managed according to this policy.

### 2.3 Data Classification
All data shall be classified based on sensitivity and criticality:  
- **Public** – Information available externally.  
- **Internal** – Company-restricted information.  
- **Confidential** – Sensitive data requiring restricted access.  
- **Highly Confidential** – Critical data with the highest level of protection.  

Access controls and security measures correspond to the classification level.

## 1. Introduction

This policy outlines the secure use of cryptographic techniques within the organization to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information. It is aligned with the requirements of ISO/IEC 27001: Information Security Management System and falls under the ISO Group A.5.1 - Policies for Information Security. The policy is classified as a Level 1 – Strategic Direction document and is designed to guide the organization towards robust information security practices.

## 2. Purpose

The purpose of this policy is to establish requirements and provide guidance for the effective and secure use of cryptographic methods to safeguard sensitive information against unauthorized access, tampering, and other security threats.

## 3. Scope

This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third parties who handle or manage cryptographic systems or sensitive data within the organization. It covers the use, management, and oversight of encryption technologies, as well as the roles and responsibilities of individuals involved.

## 4. Policy Statement

The organization is committed to ensuring the secure use of cryptography in accordance with best practices and international standards, including ISO/IEC 27001. Key objectives include:

- Protecting sensitive data through appropriate encryption methods.
- Ensuring the proper management of cryptographic keys.
- Maintaining compliance with relevant legal, regulatory, and contractual obligations.
- Preventing unauthorized disclosure, alteration, or destruction of information.

## 5. Roles and Responsibilities

- **Policy Owner:** Ryan Laird is responsible for maintaining and updating this policy as required.
- **Employees:** All employees must adhere to the requirements outlined in this policy and report any potential security incidents related to cryptographic systems.
- **IT Department:** Responsible for implementing and managing cryptographic tools and ensuring they meet the requirements of this policy.

## 6. Key Requirements

1. **Encryption Standards:**
    - Sensitive data must be encrypted using industry-standard algorithms such as AES-256 or RSA-2048.
    - Encryption keys must be generated, stored, and managed securely.
2. **Key Management:**
    - Cryptographic keys must be rotated periodically and upon suspicion of compromise.
    - Access to key management systems must be restricted to authorized personnel only.
3. **Compliance:**
    - All cryptographic practices must comply with ISO/IEC 27001 requirements and other applicable legal and regulatory standards.
4. **Documentation:**
    - All cryptographic processes and controls must be documented and reviewed regularly.

## 7. Monitoring and Review

The implementation of this policy will be monitored by the IT department. Regular reviews will be conducted to ensure compliance with the policy's objectives and to address any emerging risks or changes in technology. The current version of this policy, Version 1.1, is verified and marked as "In Review."

## 8. Exceptions

Any exceptions to this policy must be formally documented, justified, and approved by the policy owner.

## 9. Related Documents and References

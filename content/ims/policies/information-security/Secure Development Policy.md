## Purpose

The purpose of this Secure Development Policy is to establish a framework for ensuring that all software and systems developed and deployed within the organization adhere to robust security standards. The policy aligns with the ISO/IEC 27001 framework for Information Security Management Systems to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of organizational assets.

## Scope

This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party vendors involved in the development, deployment, and maintenance of software and systems within the organization. It encompasses all stages of the software development lifecycle (SDLC), including planning, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance.

## Policy Statement

The organization is committed to integrating security practices into all aspects of software and system development to mitigate risks, protect sensitive information, and ensure compliance with relevant standards and regulations. This policy is governed by the principles outlined in ISO/IEC 27001 and aims to uphold best practices in secure development.

## Objectives

1. Ensure all development activities adhere to the organization's information security policies and standards.
2. Identify and mitigate security risks throughout the SDLC.
3. Maintain compliance with ISO/IEC 27001: Information Security Management System and other applicable standards and regulations.

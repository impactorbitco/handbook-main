## 1. Introduction

At **Impact Orbit Creative Group**, we are committed to maintaining the highest standards of security across all our platforms, digital services, and partner ecosystems. We believe in a coordinated and responsible approach to identifying, reporting, and resolving security vulnerabilities that helps protect our customers, collaborators, employees, and the wider digital community.

This policy outlines our approach to handling security vulnerabilities, whether identified internally or reported by external parties. It applies to all Impact Orbit Creative Group services, tools, applications, websites, and related infrastructure.

## 2. Reporting Security Issues

If you believe you have discovered a vulnerability in a Impact Orbit Creative Group service or platform, or wish to report a security incident, we encourage you to notify us as soon as possible.

**How to Report:**

- **Email:** [security@greenorbit.digital](mailto:security@greenorbit.digital)
- **Web Form:** [greenorbit.digital/contact](https://greenorbit.digital/contact) *(example placeholder link)*
- We encourage the use of the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1) when reporting.

**What Happens Next:**

Upon receiving a security report, we will:

1. **Acknowledge receipt** of your report within 3 working days.
2. **Keep all communications confidential** and request that the reporter does the same.
3. **Investigate and validate** the vulnerability.
4. **Remediate or mitigate** the issue within **90 days**, where feasible. If a fix is not possible in this timeframe, we will provide guidance on temporary mitigations.
5. **Publicly disclose** the fix and vulnerability (as appropriate) in our release notes and potentially in a public blog post.
6. **Credit the reporter** in our disclosures (unless anonymity is requested).
7. **Maintain communication** throughout the process to ensure transparency and collaboration.

We deeply appreciate responsible disclosures and thank the security research community for helping us improve.

## 3. Vulnerabilities Identified by Impact Orbit Creative Group

When Impact Orbit Creative Group discovers a vulnerability in a third-party system or vendor product, we follow a responsible disclosure procedure to support ecosystem-wide security.

**Our Process:**

1. **Internal Review:** Our Vulnerability Analysis Team, led by our Head of Cybersecurity, assesses the severity and risk associated with the issue.
2. **Confidentiality:** All internal findings are kept confidential during the disclosure and remediation period.
3. **Vendor Notification:** We make every effort to contact the affected vendor via email, phone, or appropriate reporting channels.
4. **Information Sharing:** We share full details of the vulnerability to aid in resolution.
5. **Public Advisory:** Unless extenuating circumstances apply, we will publish an advisory at least 90 days after initial contact attempts, detailing the issue and any remediation advice.

Advisories may be published via our social media, blog, or industry forums. We aim to support broader community awareness without compromising the security of systems still under remediation.

## 4. Scope and Good Faith Expectations

This policy covers vulnerabilities in:

- Our public-facing digital services
- Internal tools and systems
- API endpoints
- Partner-integrated platforms
- Our data infrastructure (e.g., cloud services like AWS, Notion, HubSpot)

We ask researchers to:

- Avoid privacy violations or accessing unnecessary personal data
- Not disrupt or degrade our services
- Use test accounts or public information wherever possible

We commit to not pursuing legal action against those who adhere to this policy and report in good faith.

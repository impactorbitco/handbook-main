**1 Purpose and Scope**

**This policy outlines the process for handling complaints regarding the services provided by the Careers and**

**Enterprise Company (CEC). It aims to ensure that complaints are addressed fairly, consistently, and in a**

**timely manner, in line with CEC’s commitment to continuous improvement and transparency.**

**This policy applies to complaints received from all stakeholders, including schools, employers, parents,**

**learners, and members of the public.**

**2 Principles**

**CEC is committed to:**

- **Treating all complaints seriously**
- **Investigating complaints objectively and impartially**
- **Providing clear and timely communication throughout the complaints process**
- **Ensuring the complaints process is accessible, transparent, and easy to understand**
- **Protecting complainants from any form of retaliation or unfair treatment as a result of lodging a**

**3 Definition of a Complaint**

**A complaint is an expression of dissatisfaction with the service provided by CEC, whether related to service**

**delivery, staff conduct, communication, or any other matter.**

**Complaints may range from minor concerns to more serious grievances that require formal investigation.**

**4 Complaints Process**

**4.1 Informal Resolution**

**In the first instance, complainants should raise concerns informally with the relevant staff member. Many**

**issues can be resolved quickly through direct communication. This stage provides an opportunity for the**

**staff member to correct the matter without need to invoke the formal complaints process.**

**Where a complaint relates to serious misconduct by a member of staff, the complaint should be referred**

**directly to the Complaints Officer.**

**4.2 Formal Complaints**

**If the complainant is dissatisfied with the response provided by the relevant staff member, they may**

**acknowledgment will:**

- **Confirm that the complaint has been received**
- **Provide a reference number for the complaint**
- **Explain the next steps in the process and expected timeframes.**

**4.5 Investigation**

**with a relevant member of CEC’s Extended Leadership Team where appropriate. This may involve:**

- **Interviewing staff and/ or other relevant parties**
- **Reviewing records and documents**
- **Gathering additional information as necessary.**

**received. The response will:**

**An appeal may be submitted on any of the following grounds:**

**i. The handling of the complaint substantially failed to comply with this Complaints Policy**

**ii. Significant new evidence has become available which was not reasonably accessible to the**

**complainant before their receipt of the formal written response to their complaint**

**iii. The findings of the Complaints Officer would be considered manifestly unreasonable by a**

**reasonable, neutral person.**

**Appeals which relate only to a complainant’s dissatisfaction with the outcome of the complaint will not be**

**heard.**

**Appeals must be submitted in writing to the Complaints Officer within ten working days of receiving the**

**outcome.**

**provided with a revised timeframe.**

**7 Confidentiality and Data Protection**

**All complaints will be handled confidentially. Information will only be shared with those directly involved in**

**the investigation and resolution of the complaint.**

1. **Introduction**

We are committed to providing a high quality service to all our customers. When something goes wrong, we need you to tell us about it. This will allow us to put things right for you and to help improve our service for others in the future.

1. **Making a complaint**

We aim to handle complaints quickly, effectively and in a fair and honest way. We take all complaints seriously and use valuable information from investigating to help us improve our service. We treat all complaints in confidence.

1. **How you can make a complaint**

You can complain by sending an email to us at [insert email address], or you can send a written complaint by post to [insert physical address]. [Alternatively you can telephone us on [insert number] but please be aware we may, where appropriate, ask you to provide further details in writing.]

1. **How we handle complaints**

A [Director/senior employee/Manager etc] will initially review the complaint. We will acknowledge a complaint within [5] working days and give you the name and contact details of the person investigating it. We will keep you informed about the progress of the investigation. We aim to have all complaints completed within [28] working days unless we agree a different time scale with you.

1. **Time limits**

You should register a complaint as soon as you can after the date on which the event occurred. If you complain more than twelve months later, we may not be able to investigate properly. Consideration will, however, be given as to whether you had good reason for not making the complaint sooner and whether, despite the delay, it is still possible to investigate the complaint effectively and fairly.

1. **[If you are dissatisfied with the outcome**

At this stage, if you are still not satisfied, you should contact us again and we will arrange for a [Director/senior employee/Manager] who has not had any dealings with your matter to review the initial decision. We will write to you within [28] days of receiving your request for a review, confirming our final position on your complaint and explaining our reasons.]

1. **If you are still dissatisfied at this stage**

You can refer this matter to [insert details including email address] who are a certified Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) provider. [We are prepared to submit to an ADR procedure operated by that provider.]

(NOTE:

A list of certified providers is maintained on the CSTI (Trading Standards) website and can be found here https://www.tradingstandards.uk/consumers/adr-approved-bodies.
